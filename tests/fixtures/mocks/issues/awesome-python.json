About P2PNetwork\r\n\r\nlibp2p is a networking stack and library modularized out of The IPFS Project, and bundled separately for other tools to use.\r\n\r\nlibp2p is the product of a long, and arduous quest of understanding -- a deep dive into the internet's network stack, and plentiful peer-to-peer protocols from the past. Building large-scale peer-to-peer systems has been complex and difficult in the last 15 years, and libp2p is a way to fix that. It is a \"network stack\" -- a protocol suite -- that cleanly separates concerns, and enables sophisticated applications to only use the protocols they absolutely need, without giving up interoperability and upgradeability. libp2p grew out of IPFS, but it is built so that lots of people can use it, for lots of different projects. [More](https://libp2p.io/)\r\n\r\n## About Multiaddr\r\n\r\nMultiaddr aims to make network addresses future-proof, composable, and efficient.\r\n\r\nCurrent addressing schemes have a number of problems.\r\n\r\nThey hinder protocol migrations and interoperability between protocols.\r\nThey don't compose well. There are plenty of X-over-Y constructions, but only few of them can be addressed in a classic URI/URL or host:port scheme.\r\nThey don't multiplex: they address ports, not processes.\r\nThey're implicit, in that they presume out-of-band values and context.\r\nThey don't have efficient machine-readable representations.\r\nMultiaddr solves these problems by modelling network addresses as arbitrary encapsulations of protocols.\r\n\r\nMultiaddrs support addresses for any network protocol.\r\nMultiaddrs are self-describing.\r\nMultiaddrs conform to a simple syntax, making them trivial to parse and construct.\r\nMultiaddrs have human-readable and efficient machine-readable representations.\r\nMultiaddrs encapsulate well, allowing trivial wrapping and unwrapping of encapsulation layers. [More](https://multiformats.io/multiaddr/)\r\n\r\n## About Multihash\r\n\r\nMultihash is a protocol for differentiating outputs from various well-established hash functions, addressing size + encoding considerations. It is useful to write applications that future-proof their use of hashes, and allow multiple hash functions to coexist.\r\n\r\nMultihash is particularly important in systems which depend on cryptographically secure hash functions. Attacks may break the cryptographic properties of secure hash functions. These cryptographic breaks are particularly painful in large tool ecosystems, where tools may have made assumptions about hash values, such as function and digest size. Upgrading becomes a nightmare, as all tools which make those assumptions would have to be upgraded to use the new hash function and new hash digest length. Tools may face serious interoperability problems or error-prone special casing.

What is this Python project?\r\n\r\nSometimes it's very hard to find if some large files are eating up the system storage.
