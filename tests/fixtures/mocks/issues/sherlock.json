Extracted all and made a new folder on desktop\r\n3.) Installed Python 3.10.2 windows installer and have completed the install process.\r\n4.) Typed in this command into cmd running as admin: cd C:\\Users\\19706\\Desktop\\sherlock-master\r\n5.) Ran the command: pip3 install –r requirements.txt. Then get and error that says; \"ERROR: Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'\r\n\r\nPlease help with this. I've been trying to find videos and articles on this, but there has been 0 help as of now.\r\n\r\nI have also tried to clone the repo, but I get this message: git' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98627814/151645882-0ea237bb-184d-4f47-b664-d93e6f2ce3bc.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98627814/151645962-e6ddaf99-d035-4651-915d-a8d5df9dd058.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98627814/151645854-8fe86de8-ed9b-4802-a4ff-278a13b1b778.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98627814/151646313-0a6652ba-ba18-4336-bc15-9fe5dfbf4dfc.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98627814/151646350-cd2b892d-091b-499a-b28b-771207b76d63.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98627814/151646504-a278edb4-515f-4a1f-936e-3c062eca29cc.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sherlock-project/sherlock/issues/1244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sherlock-project/sherlock/issues/1244/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sherlock-project/sherlock/issues/1242","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sherlock-project/sherlock","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sherlock-project/sherlock/issues/1242/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sherlock-project/sherlock/issues/1242/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sherlock-project/sherlock/issues/1242/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/pull/1242","id":1116773326,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCbcoz84xtHak","number":1242,"title":"poetry packaging","user":{"login":"stranger-danger-zamu","id":70606846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjA2ODQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70606846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stranger-danger-zamu","html_url":"https://github.com/stranger-danger-zamu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stranger-danger-zamu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stranger-danger-zamu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stranger-danger-zamu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stranger-danger-zamu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stranger-danger-zamu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stranger-danger-zamu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stranger-danger-zamu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stranger-danger-zamu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stranger-danger-zamu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2022-01-27T21:51:19Z","updated_at":"2022-02-04T11:52:51Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sherlock-project/sherlock/pulls/1242","html_url":"https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/pull/1242","diff_url":"https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/pull/1242.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/pull/1242.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"Fixes #1241.\r\n\r\nHere are the changes required to package this with Poetry.
