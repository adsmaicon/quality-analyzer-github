However, this is the first time I've seen either that function or file mentioned (since there doesn't appear to have been any mention of either of them in parts 1-5).  There are plenty of references to arch/x86/boot/main.c [3], but they're not directly related as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nI wasn't disoriented for too long, but it makes me wonder if I missed something, or if there was earlier material you omitted by mistake.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides/blob/master/Booting/linux-bootstrap-6.md\r\n[2] https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.16/init/main.c\r\n[3] https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.16/arch/x86/boot/main.c","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/0xAX/linux-insides/issues/743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/0xAX/linux-insides/issues/743/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/0xAX/linux-insides/issues/740","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/0xAX/linux-insides","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/0xAX/linux-insides/issues/740/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/0xAX/linux-insides/issues/740/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/0xAX/linux-insides/issues/740/events","html_url":"https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides/issues/740","id":721596787,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MjE1OTY3ODc=","number":740,"title":"eBook version","user":{"login":"JamesSWilliams","id":61462621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDYyNjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61462621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesSWilliams","html_url":"https://github.com/JamesSWilliams","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesSWilliams/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesSWilliams/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesSWilliams/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesSWilliams/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesSWilliams/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesSWilliams/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesSWilliams/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesSWilliams/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesSWilliams/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2020-10-14T16:15:37Z","updated_at":"2021-09-30T21:04:14Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hey,\r\n\r\nreally like your book, are there any plans to also release a pdf or epub?\r\nThe link show in #156 doesn't work anymore.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/0xAX/linux-insides/issues/740/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/0xAX/linux-insides/issues/740/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/0xAX/linux-insides/issues/739","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/0xAX/linux-insides","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/0xAX/linux-insides/issues/739/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/0xAX/linux-insides/issues/739/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/0xAX/linux-insides/issues/739/events","html_url":"https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides/issues/739","id":721554752,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MjE1NTQ3NTI=","number":739,"title":"Donation link broken","user":{"login":"jmetrius","id":981822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MTgyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/981822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmetrius","html_url":"https://github.com/jmetrius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmetrius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmetrius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmetrius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmetrius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmetrius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmetrius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmetrius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmetrius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmetrius/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2020-10-14T15:21:03Z","updated_at":"2020-10-14T15:21:03Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"The donation button in README.md throws a 404 error.
