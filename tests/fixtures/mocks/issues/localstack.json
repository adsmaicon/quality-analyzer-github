Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues and read the documentation\r\n\r\n### Question\r\n\r\nI am using localstack's API Gateway to locally work on a REST API I have running on AWS. For authentication, this API uses JWT tokens, passed through the \"authorization\" HTTP header, with value \"Bearer <the JWT token>\". Authentication is optional, so requests may or may not include said header\r\n\r\nOn the app running on AWS, the \"authorization\" header received by my app matches exactly what is sent in the request to the public URL (that is proxied through API Gateway) - specifically, if no header is sent by the end user, no header is present on the request received by my app. \r\n\r\nHowever, on localstack, if I issue a GET request, with no \"authorization\" header, my application get a \"authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 <...>\". For context/more info, if my request to localstack has a \"authorization\" header, is seems to be passed as-is.\r\n\r\nSo it seems that, if no \"authorization\" header is present, localstack injects one, which differs from the behavior on AWS. I am using terraform to configure both, with the config for localstack piggybacking off the one I am using for AWS, so I am pretty confident the difference does not lie there. \r\n\r\nBefore I spend a few hours trying to set up a PoC repo that illustrates this issue, I wanted to ask if this is known/intentional.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your time, and sorry if this is somehow documented

Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nWhen making a curl call to against localstack in a container, it causes localstack to die

I can get it to work correctly if I force a specific cipher that matches the browser. ie \r\n`curl -v -k --ciphers TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 https://localhost:4566/health`\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe

Does not matter which region is used by the client, Localstack S3 API never returns `301` status code as real AWS API would. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, `get-bucket-location` always returns the region of the client:\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAll specific-bucket-related operation should require client to be configured to the same region as a bucket. Otherwise API should return `301` HTTP status code with a message like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[PermanentRedirect] The bucket you are attempting to access must be addressed using the specified endpoint. Please send all future requests to this endpoint.\r\n```\n\n### How are you starting LocalStack?\n\nWith a docker-compose file\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n#### How are you starting localstack (e.g., `bin/localstack` command, arguments, or `docker-compose.yml`)\r\n\r\n   docker-compose.yml\r\n\r\n#### Client commands (e.g., AWS SDK code snippet, or sequence of \"awslocal\" commands)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-bucket --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 --region eu-west-1\r\n{\r\n    \"Location\": \"http://my-bucket.s3.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/\"\r\n}\r\n$ aws s3api get-bucket-location --bucket my-bucket  --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 --region eu-west-2\r\n{\r\n    \"LocationConstraint\": \"eu-west-2\"\r\n}\r\n$ aws s3api get-bucket-location --bucket my-bucket  --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 --region eu-west-1\r\n{\r\n    \"LocationConstraint\": \"eu-west-1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n```markdown\n- OS: MacOS 12.2.1\r\n- LocalStack: 0.14.1\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/5748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/5748/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/5747","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/5747/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/5747/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/5747/events","html_url":"https://github.com/localstack/localstack/issues/5747","id":1180134853,"node_id":"I_kwDOBEnY0s5GV23F","number":5747,"title":"Web Console: Lambda - Allow expanding lambda logs","user":{"login":"LukaHedt","id":93953637,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZmeZQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93953637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt","html_url":"https://github.com/LukaHedt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":720023316,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjAwMjMzMTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/labels/web-ui","name":"web-ui","color":"d65c7c","default":false,"description":null},{"id":2695724013,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjk1NzI0MDEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"B9A2E0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3453233917,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBEnY0s7N1Cr9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/labels/aws:lambda","name":"aws:lambda","color":"F29100","default":false,"description":"AWS Lambda"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2022-03-24T22:53:22Z","updated_at":"2022-03-29T11:28:48Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Feature description\n\nCurrently the Localstack Web Console truncates long logs in the lambda page.\r\n\r\nIdeally, a method of viewing the entire log would be ideal.
