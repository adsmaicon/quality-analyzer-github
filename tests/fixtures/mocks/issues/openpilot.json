the NaN reset test in openpilot was still failing after adding a `reset()` function to the acados OCP solver https://github.com/acados/acados/pull/796 , while for the one I had added in acados this reset function was enough\r\n- Resetting also the HPIPM memory (implemented here: https://github.com/acados/acados/pull/803) makes the openpilot NaN reset test pass.\r\n\r\nI guess all that is left to

We can also request zero torque and set the torque request bit to 1, and we still fault under the exact same conditions. So the EPS isn't looking at commanded torque, driver torque, or EPS torque at all for faults.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the user can override as fast as possible and no faults should occur as we cut steering until the rate falls below the threshold the EPS seems to have internally.\r\n\r\nWe may be able to send messages at a lower rate and then keep steering for longer, as perhaps the internal counter for the rate limit works on messages, not time (as do the torque rate limits).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/commaai/openpilot/issues/24067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/commaai/openpilot/issues/24067/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/commaai/openpilot/issues/24066","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/commaai/openpilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/commaai/openpilot/issues/24066/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/commaai/openpilot/issues/24066/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/commaai/openpilot/issues/24066/events","html_url":"https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/issues/24066","id":1185273245,"node_id":"I_kwDOBHK6Ic5GpdWd","number":24066,"title":"Improve alert verbosity","user":{"login":"pd0wm","id":1314752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTQ3NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1314752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pd0wm","html_url":"https://github.com/pd0wm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pd0wm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pd0wm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pd0wm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pd0wm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pd0wm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pd0wm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pd0wm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pd0wm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pd0wm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":487762874,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0ODc3NjI4NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/commaai/openpilot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/commaai/openpilot/milestones/21","html_url":"https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/milestone/21","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/commaai/openpilot/milestones/21/labels","id":7623657,"node_id":"MI_kwDOBHK6Ic4AdFPp","number":21,"title":"0.8.14","description":"","creator":{"login":"adeebshihadeh","id":8762862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjI4NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8762862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeebshihadeh","html_url":"https://github.com/adeebshihadeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeebshihadeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeebshihadeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeebshihadeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeebshihadeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeebshihadeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeebshihadeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeebshihadeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeebshihadeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeebshihadeh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":14,"closed_issues":5,"state":"open","created_at":"2022-01-30T19:55:42Z","updated_at":"2022-03-31T04:57:07Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2022-03-29T18:47:00Z","updated_at":"2022-03-29T23:59:21Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Alerts should give more insight into what the actual problem is.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Camera Malfunction might also be lag.

It still takes around a second, but I think it is as fast as stock and no one will complain (any slow movement after you start rolling is the planners fault).\r\n\r\nAlways telling the vehicle there is a lead 1 meter away seems to make braking way more responsive.  So much that it seems like the lag is only about 0.5 seconds (or less) normally now and we no longer need to add double the error where accel is negative.\r\n\r\nThis has only been tested on a 2020 palisade and the request values used to get you started when stopped may need to be adjusted for different vehicles (but hopefully not).  I set these values kind of conservative for now because if you set them higher the vehicle does start faster, but it will always go all the way to the requested value and this can cause a harsh jerk when the transition happens back to the plan accel (if it is still small and positive).\r\n\r\nI also noticed that sometimes the plan can take a while to reach `vEgoStarting` which caused further delay starting from a stop, so lowering it makes starting from a stop faster and more consistent.  Perhaps we want to do this for other manufacturers, too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/commaai/openpilot/issues/24053/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/commaai/openpilot/issues/24053/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/commaai/openpilot/issues/24046","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/commaai/openpilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/commaai/openpilot/issues/24046/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/commaai/openpilot/issues/24046/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/commaai/openpilot/issues/24046/events","html_url":"https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/issues/24046","id":1181449317,"node_id":"I_kwDOBHK6Ic5Ga3xl","number":24046,"title":"Support setting to current speed while gas is pressed via set button","user":{"login":"sshane","id":25857203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODU3MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25857203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshane","html_url":"https://github.com/sshane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshane/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":487762874,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0ODc3NjI4NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/commaai/openpilot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2022-03-26T01:35:48Z","updated_at":"2022-03-26T10:24:14Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"*when not pcmCruise and openpilot is handling button presses.
