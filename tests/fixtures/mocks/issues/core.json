The problem\n\nI'm a new user of HA trying to migrate from Homeseer and I've recently installed the Insteon Integration and I'm trying to migrate my existing 40+ Insteon network, however I'm having an issue with losing connectivity to the Insteon Hub model 2245-222. I have tried rebooting HA which sometime works but more often I need to reboot the hub to re-establish the connection to HA. When HA stops communicating to the Insteon hub I find the the native Insteon app has no issue reaching the hub and I have full control of all devices. Since I have installed the Insteon integration I don't think I have made it past 1 day before the connection is lost, for example rebooted yesterday afternoon and it appears the system went off line at a little before 1am this morning.\r\nI'm hoping you can help me figure out why I'm having the issue.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time\r\nRichard\n\n### What version of Home Assistant Core has the

Proposed change\r\nThe latest beta includes Alarm Control Panel (#67164); however this doesn't work for the Protexial alarm. Working with a user via Discord, I found the culprit and was able to fix this.\r\n\r\nApparently Overkiz expects a string, instead of a list... And for disarm, when `None` is passed in the args, it will make a list with None, and thus commands without parameters will throw an error.\r\n\r\nI am not a huge fan of the current code; thus all feedback is appreciated.\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n<!--\r\n  What type of change does your PR introduce to Home Assistant?\r\n  NOTE: Please, check only 1! box!\r\n  If your PR requires multiple boxes to be checked, you'll most likely need to\r\n  split it into multiple PRs.
