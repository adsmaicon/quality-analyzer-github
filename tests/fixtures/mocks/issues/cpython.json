Pyodide's public API allows toggling signal handling on and off at runtime, so this flag allows us to maintain that same behavior. This patch rebases cleanly onto Python 3.10.2 except for `ceval.c` where `CHECK_EVAL_BREAKER` is new in Python 3.11. \r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/2332 where a similar patch is tested in Pyodide with Python 3.10.2. I tried to build Pyodide against Python 3.11.0a6 to test this exact version of the patch but I ran into a very large number of linker errors that I wasn't able to resolve so I gave up.\n\n<!--
