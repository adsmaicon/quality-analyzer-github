vulnerable, and many popular libraries have had this vulnerability found. More info: https://github.com/HoLyVieR/prototype-pollution-nsec18\r\n\r\nmy two naughty strings contain the standard naughty JSON with a __proto__ property, and a less likely but still possible attack where `obj[a][b][c] = value` is needed. the JSON keys are common names that are likely to break any application (items, data, attributes)\r\n\r\n### JavaScript Object properties\r\n\r\nthose are properties on the default Object prototype that will cause issues in two cases:\r\n\r\n1. Programmer writes `obj.<obj-method>()` on a user-controlled object (can crash if user supplies this method) -- the correct thing to do is `Object.prototype.<name>.call(obj, ...)`\r\n2. Programmer uses `obj[key]` on a user-controlled object to check if a key exists - this will always be truthy for Object properties, but incorrect.
