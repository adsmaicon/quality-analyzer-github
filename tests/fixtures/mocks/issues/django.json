The AP style guide uses a dictionary that isn't available freely. However, Microsoft have a style guide and refer to it, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens). I'm assuming that's good enough for what we're aiming for.

seeing a colleague use `Signer`/`TimestampSigner` without the `salt` argument passed, I looked at the docs and found that they do not really encourage its use. This is unfortunate, because it really is required to avoid hacks once you have more than one use of it in your application. The best way to ensure correct usage is to always add the argument.\r\n\r\nWhile I was there, I took the opportunity to explain and encourage better patterns, and updated the `get_signed_cookie` and `set_signed_cookie` docs accordingly.\r\n\r\nPassing `salt` to  `set_signed_cookie` is not quite as necessary, because it already uses the `key` value as a salt, but I think it is still helpful. In a large project, it's possible that the same key could be validly used for `set_signed_cookie(key)` but with different purposes - for example they might use a different `path` argument, so the cookies wouldn't clash at the browser level, and therefore they wouldn't notice the clash.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/django/django/issues/15439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/django/django/issues/15439/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/django/django/issues/15430","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/django/django","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/django/django/issues/15430/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/django/django/issues/15430/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/django/django/issues/15430/events","html_url":"https://github.com/django/django/pull/15430","id":1138726314,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAD-Lgs4y3Eet","number":15430,"title":"Fixed

The previous version is currently in the class as `format_old` for the purposes of allowing comparison of various format strings I might not have thought of, for regressions etc.\r\n\r\nI've captured all the format strings exercised by the test suite, and plucked a few that look both complex and simple, to try and gather a decent range of uses. I have also run _all_ the format strings in the test suite through a bunch of ipython `%timeit` runs in a loop, which isn't exactly a thorough and stable benchmark, but they all looked promising enough.
