attempt at #46246.  Perf impact isn't _as_ bad, but is still ugly, see asvs posted below.\r\n\r\nThe lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        if info.use_utc:\r\n            local_val = stamps[i]\r\n        elif info.use_tzlocal:\r\n            local_val = tz_convert_utc_to_tzlocal(stamps[i], tz)\r\n        elif info.use_fixed:\r\n            local_val = stamps[i] + info.delta\r\n        else:\r\n            pos = bisect_right_i8(tdata, stamps[i], info.ntrans) - 1\r\n            local_val = stamps[i] + info.deltas[pos]\r\n```\r\n\r\nare repeated 5 times in this file,  once more with small edits in tzconversion.pyx, and potentially a couple others.  So I'd _really_ like to turn them into either a Localizer method or just a module-level function.  Doing so causes even bigger performance hits.\r\n\r\nAlso these lines are liable to change as we add zoneinfo and non-nano support, so making them a function would be helpful for keeping them in sync.\r\n\r\nThe only idea I have for troubleshooting perf is to move the `info.use_foo` checks (or the info.delta and info.deltas lookups) outside of the loop, but that doesn't seem to make any difference.\r\n\r\nAsking for help from the big guns cc @jreback @WillAyd @realead @da-woods\r\n\r\n```\r\ntime asv continuous -E virtualenv -f 1.01 main HEAD -b tslibs.normalize -b
