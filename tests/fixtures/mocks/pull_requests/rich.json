[black](https://github.com/psf/black) with default args on new code.\r\n- [ ] I've updated CHANGELOG.md and CONTRIBUTORS.md where appropriate.\r\n- [ ] I've added tests for new code.\r\n- [x] I accept that @willmcgugan may be pedantic in the code review.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis enables a few extra mypy checks, and fixes type bugs exposed by those. There were three features enabled, but I've left one off: `warn_unrachable = true`. While it is really useful, and helped expose a couple of the issues fixed here, it also requires type ignoring in about 5-7 places unavoidably, so I've left it off. The most irritating one is `if sys.platform.startswith(\"win\")` constructs, which it will notice are unreachable if you are typing targeting a different platform. MyPy might fix this in https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12286, which would run all platforms/versions in parallel and then combine the results (which would be really fantastic!), but until then, it's likely better just to manually add `--warn-unreachable` once in a while and make sure the errors reported are expected. (Depending on your preference, of course - I've been turning it on mostly, but I usually don't have quite as many ignores due to it - I thik I counted at least 7 here. If you want to see it, let me know, and I'll PR it).\r\n\r\nI'll comment inline on the others, but this is one fix:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx: Iterable[Any] = ...\r\nlen(x)\r\n```\r\n\r\nis invalid. You can't take the length of an iterator. Someone could correctly put an iterator function in here, and this will break. Either this should be `Sequence` (which is what I've used here), or you should iterate over the iterator and build a sequence like a list or a tuple and then use

I was actually looking for a module that would limit the stack traces to code I actually wrote so I don't have to scroll back through 15 pages of stuff I didn't write to get to the actually relevant error on the lines I did write.\r\n\r\nSo, while `rich.traceback.install(suppress=[])` _almost_ does what I want, there was no way to actually achieve my goal without really annoying acrobatics; since, what I really want is `rich.traceback.install(suppress=[lambda fname: recognize_my_own_modules(fname)])`\r\n\r\nThis PR adds callable suppress_entity support. It's already doing what I want in my project by simply installing my modified version; but I doubt I'm the only person that would want this feature so I cleaned it up for sharing.","created_at":"2021-10-24T16:22:42Z","updated_at":"2021-11-22T17:05:14Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4d65847f8cd7a01caf4eb0b471301f01ba3bf0d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Textualize/rich/pulls/1621/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Textualize/rich/pulls/1621/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Textualize/rich/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Textualize/rich/issues/1621/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Textualize/rich/statuses/a3df6b1874612391a9f6da291a8d368215fae6d5","head":{"label":"jettero:callable-suppress","ref":"callable-suppress","sha":"a3df6b1874612391a9f6da291a8d368215fae6d5","user":{"login":"jettero","id":54520,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero","html_url":"https://github.com/jettero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":420714609,"node_id":"R_kgDOGROYcQ","name":"rich","full_name":"jettero/rich","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jettero","id":54520,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero","html_url":"https://github.com/jettero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jettero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jettero/rich","description":"Rich

`total` attribute of the `progress.add_task` method or `track` function.\r\n\r\nThis will display a pulsing progress bar. Also, columns can be updated as normal with calls to `progress.update`. The number of element completed and the time elapse will work as expected. The value for the total in columns will be `?` and any completion percentage will be calculated as `0%` or equivalent.\r\n\r\nThe new progress bar has been added in the example provided by the module `rich.progress`.\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-19T03:19:28Z","updated_at":"2022-02-13T03:50:46Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e242badb2db7709994a097475ab598c8a6b2ea85","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Textualize/rich/pulls/1609/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Textualize/rich/pulls/1609/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Textualize/rich/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Textualize/rich/issues/1609/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Textualize/rich/statuses/1725ac2fa6353b0e992bedb25667f79e1c67df1f","head":{"label":"mrvkino:indeterminate_progress","ref":"indeterminate_progress","sha":"1725ac2fa6353b0e992bedb25667f79e1c67df1f","user":{"login":"mrvkino","id":279511,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTUxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/279511?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino","html_url":"https://github.com/mrvkino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":411501479,"node_id":"R_kgDOGIcDpw","name":"rich","full_name":"mrvkino/rich","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mrvkino","id":279511,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTUxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/279511?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino","html_url":"https://github.com/mrvkino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrvkino/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mrvkino/rich","description":"Rich
