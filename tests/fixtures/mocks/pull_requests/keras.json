the following contribution: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/45338\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n- change the behavior of `data_adapter.DataAdapter` and `data_adapter.DataHandler` to accept batch size that are increasing during training\r\n- add unit test with `keras.utils.Sequence` that increases its batch size from 5 to 10 over the course of 2 epochs\r\n- add unit test which checks correct behavior of `data_adapter.DataAdapter` and `data_adapter.DataHandler`\r\n\r\n**Resources:**\r\n- Idea for increasing batch size: https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00489\r\n- Rasa workaround:

small bugfix to improve performance when using `sample_weight` in `model.fit()`. Currently list comprehension is used to check that there are no None is sample_weight. This creates a very noticeable delay in the start of the fitting procedure when comparing a model with vs. without weights added.  The list comprehensions are changed to array operations to improve performance.","created_at":"2022-03-05T06:17:39Z","updated_at":"2022-03-21T22:57:45Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"528b9bfcb4937f426f372bc65fd0fe14709825d3","assignee":{"login":"gbaned","id":48215717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MjE1NzE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48215717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned","html_url":"https://github.com/gbaned","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"gbaned","id":48215717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MjE1NzE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48215717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned","html_url":"https://github.com/gbaned","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbaned/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3261964274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMjYxOTY0Mjc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keras-team/keras/labels/size:XS","name":"size:XS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keras-team/keras/pulls/16177/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keras-team/keras/pulls/16177/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keras-team/keras/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keras-team/keras/issues/16177/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keras-team/keras/statuses/742b30f39db92c1b6e56c95994374eb16a3c8617","head":{"label":"nershman:master","ref":"master","sha":"742b30f39db92c1b6e56c95994374eb16a3c8617","user":{"login":"nershman","id":755742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTc0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/755742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman","html_url":"https://github.com/nershman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":466364636,"node_id":"R_kgDOG8wo3A","name":"keras","full_name":"nershman/keras","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nershman","id":755742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTc0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/755742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman","html_url":"https://github.com/nershman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nershman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nershman/keras","description":"Deep
