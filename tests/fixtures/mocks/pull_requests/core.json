This has caused some problems where the still images were not identified correctly causing the user config flow or yaml import to fail, e.g. #69011\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n<!--\r\n  What type of change does your PR introduce to Home Assistant?\r\n  NOTE: Please, check only 1! box!\r\n  If your PR requires multiple boxes to be checked, you'll most likely need to\r\n  split it into multiple PRs.

This seems to be more effective at identifying images, and works for all the test cases supplied so far that I've tested.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to quickly resolve the issue.

 You are amazing! Thanks for contributing to our project!\r\n  Please, DO NOT DELETE ANY TEXT from this template! (unless instructed).\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Proposed change\r\nA previous fix for a bug that happens when no IPv4 addresses are available on the system added an explicit error when this happens. However, Home Assistant can run just fine in a suitably configured IPv6-only environment, so this explicit error in fact constitutes a regression. So let's remove the error again and restore the functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n<!--\r\n  What type of change does your PR introduce to Home Assistant?\r\n  NOTE: Please, check only 1! box!\r\n  If your PR requires multiple boxes to be checked, you'll most likely need to\r\n  split it into multiple PRs.

Proposed change\r\n(marking as a draft for now since this is not important for current beta).\r\n\r\nFollow up of https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/68996. Currently only a few zones are mapped, since the AlarmControlPanel entity doesn't support this. This select entity will allow a user to enable all other zones.\r\nAll available options: `(A, B, C, A,B, B,C, A,C, A,B,C)`.\r\n\r\nThis will still work together with the Alarm Control Panel entity. Zones that are not mapped will be mapped to 'custom bypass'.\r\n\r\n**Disarmed:**\r\n<img width=\"360\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-03-31 at 18 25 01\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1424596/161107443-0957a7dd-9e09-4452-ae18-197f7ab6cd21.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**A:**\r\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-03-31 at 18 25 13\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1424596/161107421-c06d7340-e0e6-4ff2-aad7-ebcecb159bb1.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**A,C:**\r\n<img width=\"399\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-03-31 at 18 44 24\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1424596/161107396-8ab51519-67a4-4423-ad68-0faaaa8c9749.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n<!--\r\n  What type of change does your PR introduce to Home Assistant?\r\n  NOTE: Please, check only 1! box!\r\n  If your PR requires multiple boxes to be checked, you'll most likely need to\r\n  split it into multiple PRs.

Proposed change\r\nThe latest beta includes Alarm Control Panel (#67164); however this doesn't work for the Protexial alarm. Working with a user via Discord, I found the culprit and was able to fix this.\r\n\r\nApparently Overkiz expects a string, instead of a list... And for disarm, when `None` is passed in the args, it will make a list with None, and thus commands without parameters will throw an error.\r\n\r\nI am not a huge fan of the current code; thus all feedback is appreciated.\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n<!--\r\n  What type of change does your PR introduce to Home Assistant?\r\n  NOTE: Please, check only 1! box!\r\n  If your PR requires multiple boxes to be checked, you'll most likely need to\r\n  split it into multiple PRs.

However, in some cases the data imported from `configuration.yaml` may be incomplete.\r\nThis makes sure the config entry data has all the needed keys by importing deprecated configuration keys found in `configuration.yaml` but not in the config entry data.\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n<!--\r\n  What type of change does your PR introduce to Home Assistant?\r\n  NOTE: Please, check only 1! box!\r\n  If your PR requires multiple boxes to be checked, you'll most likely need to\r\n  split it into multiple PRs.

Proposed change\r\nThe DimmerExteriorHeating is a Somfy Terrace Heater (outdoor) that you can set from 0 to 100. The mapping needs to be inverted since 0 = on and 100 = off on the back-end.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense to map this to a number entity (slider) even though this is a 'climate' device. Climate entities don't support this scenario.\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Dependency upgrade\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New integration (thank you!)\r\n- [x] New feature (which adds functionality to an existing integration)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix/feature causing existing functionality to break)\r\n- [ ] Code quality improvements to existing code or addition of tests\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n<!--\r\n  Details are important, and help maintainers processing your PR.\r\n  Please be sure to fill out additional details, if applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- This PR fixes or closes issue: fixes #\r\n- This PR is related to issue: \r\n- Link to documentation pull request: \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!--\r\n  Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.
