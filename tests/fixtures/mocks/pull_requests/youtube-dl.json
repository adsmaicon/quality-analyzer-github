At this point it supports video watch URLs at the path /tv/[category]/[id]/. All tests are passing on 2.7.18 and 3.9.11 (I wasn't able to run 2.6.* on my dev machine).\r\n\r\nI had plans to include the latter part of the url as the display_id, but I must be misunderstanding the named capture groups in _VALID_URL, as this does not seem to be getting added to the info dict.\r\n\r\nI'd like to support the embed url format as well, e.g https://ott.nbl.com.au/en-int/embed/1303323, as this is used in og:video tags and might be a simplification for the extractor, but I didn't want to add that functionality at this time with my limited knowledge of what's available in

Please follow the guide below\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Before submitting a *pull request* make sure you have:\r\n- [x] [Searched](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/search?q=is%3Apr&type=Issues) the bugtracker for similar pull requests\r\n- [x] Read [adding new extractor tutorial](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#adding-support-for-a-new-site)\r\n- [x] Read [youtube-dl coding conventions](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#youtube-dl-coding-conventions) and adjusted the code to meet them\r\n- [x] Covered the code with tests (note that PRs without tests will be REJECTED)\r\n- [x] Checked the code with [flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8)\r\n\r\n### In order to be accepted and merged into youtube-dl each piece of code must be in public domain or released under [Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/). Check one of the following options:\r\n- [x] I am the original author of this code and I am willing to release it under [Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/), except for code taken from yt-dlp for which either this or the below was separately asserted\r\n- [ ] I am not the original author of this code but it is in public domain or released under [Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/) (provide reliable

request* and other information\r\n\r\nThere is a set of options for displaying values from the `info_dict` but these options don't cover all the values of interest (eg https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/pull/30703).\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a simplified version of the `--print` option from yt-dlp:\r\n```md\r\n    -O, --print TEMPLATE                 Simulate, quiet but print the given fields.\r\n                                         Either a field name or similar formatting\r\n                                         as the output template can be used\r\n```\r\nUnlike the yt-dlp option, but consistent with yt-dl's output templates, only actual field names are allowed in the template (not index paths).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```shellsession\r\n$ youtube-dl --print 'The unsanitised default output filename is' --print '%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s' --print 'The sanitised output filename is' --get-filename 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbJOTdZBX1g'\r\nThe unsanitised default output filename is\r\nYouTube Rewind 2018: Everyone Controls Rewind | #YouTubeRewind-YbJOTdZBX1g.mp4\r\nThe sanitised output filename is\r\nYouTube Rewind 2018 - Everyone Controls Rewind _ #YouTubeRewind-YbJOTdZBX1g.mp4\r\n$\r\n```\r\nTo do:\r\n- [ ] add test(s)\r\n\r\nCloses #30703

request* and other information\r\nThis PR replaces #29796 which was orphaned when @kikuyan's account was deleted.\r\n\r\nThe PR makes the following fixes and improvements to the Facebook extractor:\r\n- improves title, add description, preferring metadata in ld+json if present\r\n- adds another getter for `attachment`s (from PR #30496, issue)\r\n- as ld+json VideoObject type seems to be gone since PR was first made, adds SocialMediaPosting type as a fallback\r\n- when web pages are analyzed as playlists but consist of single video, treats the pages as regular video pages to extract metadata well (examples: tests 7, 9, 10)\r\n- makes test skip for now: TestDownload.test_Facebook_8: the page cannot be parsed (get `ERROR: This video is only available for registered users.`) while it can be opened by a browser.\r\n\r\nThe PR makes the following improvement to the `extractor/common.py`:\r\n- adds SocialMediaPosting for author extraction in `InfoExtractor._json_ld()` (replaces PR #30513).\r\n\r\nResolves #29421, resolves #23627, resolves #23180, resolves #14156.\r\nResolves #30472, resolves #30474, resolves #30650, resolves #30681.\r\n\r\nCloses #29796

The same issue affects yt-dl as the relevant code is substantially identical.\r\n\r\nThese problems were identified:\r\n* the page uses Anvato embedding, which after Anvato was bought up by Google, now seems to be hosted at `mp.lura.live`, so the back-end Anvato extractor needed to be updated;\r\n* the page itself has a structure not supported by the `CBSLocalArticleIE` extractor, so the Anvato access key and video ID have to be extracted in a different way, from a script inside the `section#featured-media` element containing the required fields as the `accessKey` and `video` members of JSON that is passed to `AnvatoPlayer('p0').init()`;\r\n* default metadata could be extracted from the `ld+json` script element;\r\n* the extractor first tries to extract a URL suitable for the `SendtoNewsIE` extractor; although no page was found with this, that extractor also needed a rework.\r\n\r\nFor the `AnvatoIE` extractor, a similar pattern of requests to the original is needed, but with slightly different parameters and different API URLs.\r\n1. From `'https://access.mp.lura.live/anvacks/%s?apikey=%s' % (access_key, self._API_KEY)`, get JSON containing all the API URLs with replacement fields that have to be replaced with the video parameters.\r\n2. Use the `api.time` member to get the server time (UNIX epoch).\r\n3. Use the `api.video` member to get video metadata JSON using query parameters and POST data calculated, similar to the existing, from the video data URL and server time, which has the same format as the JSON expected from the old Anvato API.\r\n\r\nFor the SendtoNews extractor, the API returned JSON with media links in `configuration.sources.src` of a playlist item instead of `jwconfiguration`.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the necessary changes to all three extractors.\r\n\r\nFor all extractors, tests had to be validated, replaced or fixed.\r\n\r\nA small fix from the pending PR #29698 is pulled in to make some tests work under Python 2.\r\n\r\nResolves

(caused by KeyError('dataUrl')); please report this issue on https://yt-dl.org/bug . Make sure you are using the latest version; see  https://yt-dl.org/update  on how to update.

The code for the relevant extractor (`GoIE`) is basically the same in yt-dl and the same failure occurs.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to retrieve JSON from http://api.contents.watchabc.go.com/vp2/ws/contents/3000/videos/001/001/-1/-1/-1/VDKA26139487/-1/-1.json was found to have succeeded but the returned JSON had no video, as the error message indicated:\r\n```\r\n{'ver': '3000', 'build': '2170', 'device': '9024', 'brand': '13', 'xmlns': 'http://abc.go.com/vp2/ws/xmlns', 'count': '0', 'totalcount': '0'}\r\n```\r\nWith the API version path element changed from 3000 to 4000 the desired full result was returned.\r\n\r\nAdditionally several of the Disney sites targeted by the extractor are no longer operational (invalid domain, or redirect to another site's home or mini-site page).\r\n\r\nThis PR applies the consequent changes to the yt-dlp extractor and merges the two extractors as far as possible:\r\n* the API URL is updated to use 4000;\r\n* valid sites are tagged with attribute `'go': True` and the attribute is used to filter the sites when constructing the URL pattern, etc;\r\n* the yt-dlp URL pattern is used and extended;\r\n* some extraction regexes were relaxed or removed;\r\n* title extraction defaults to extraction from the `og:title` `<meta>` value;\r\n* valid tests are fixed and invalid tests flagged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes yt-dl version of

After pulling out some constant regex expressions and changing a loop over assignment operators into a regex alternative match, the execution time (Py 2.7) went from 22s to 18s. The number of function calls was down by almost 1M, nearly 25% (application extracting 42 YT pages).\r\n\r\nThe regex optimisations apply to expressions that used f-strings in the yt-dlp version, which are said to be faster than formatting operations available to yt-dl; however, the loop optimisation, and one already made in the back-port, could equally apply to the yt-dlp version.\r\n\r\nCurrently constants used in the `JSInterpreter` class include both global and class vars:\r\n* globals: `_OPERATORS`, `_ASSIGN_OPERATORS`, `_NAME_RE`, `_MATCHING_PARENS`\r\n* class vars: `_EXPR_SPLIT_RE`, `_VARNAME_RE`, `_ARRAY_REF_RE`, `_FN_CALL_RE`, `_MEMBER_REF_RE`, `_FN_NAME_RE`, `_FN_DEF_RE`, `_ASSIGN_EXPR_RE`.\r\n\r\nAs to whether the constant regex expressions used for parsing should be class or global vars, probably the following heuristics should apply:\r\n* constants that are characteristics of the JS language should be _vars of the module or the class\r\n* constants that are specific to the internal workings of the JS interpreter should be __vars of the
