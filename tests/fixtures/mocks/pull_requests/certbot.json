matching this. \r\n```bash\r\ngrep -r -E \"\\.format\" certbot*   \r\n```\r\n\r\nI think switching to f-strings is one small step in the right direction of the black/flake8 adoption.\r\n\r\n## Pull

is an attempt at adding a new flag `--renew-before-expiry` which works in the same way as the `renew_before_expiry` renewal config file option. It is often easier to supply a flag rather than find and update a config file, especially in scripted systems.\r\n\r\nNotable is how this behaves when both the new CLI flag and config file option are present for a certificate. In that case the longer interval (i.e. earlier renewal date) is selected. If either option is set the same as the default then it is ignored.\r\n\r\nThis is motivated by the default 30 day period causing difficulty for customers of a project I work on, as they often have alarms that fire at the 30 day mark for vendor certs, so we wanted to renew at 35 days, but disliked the relative complexity of having scripts update renewal config files.\r\n\r\nThis is my first PR on the project, so hopefully I haven't missed anything! :)\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] If the change being made is to a [distributed

Issue did not manifest in 'renew' subcommand but was present in 'certonly' and 'run' code paths due to how object reference was passed.\r\n\r\nSuggested permanent fix:  Collapse config object references, store it for each given domain in a canonical object attribute and always use it from there.\r\n\r\nStill needs:\r\n- a decision on making renewal.py:_reconstitute public _for real_ or

PR allows Certbot to utilize full include tree for searches that need to know about the ancestors. Search for `mod_macro` block is included in this PR. The functionality also takes the possibility of multiple includes into account.\r\n\r\nBecause of the limitations of the current parsing engine, we have to search includes from the root up. This also introduces quite big performance penalty, especially if done dynamically. This is why a dictionary of `Include`, `IncludeOptions` and their values are saved to the parser object, and refreshed when new includes are

small PR implements the option of updating / deleting domains under a base domain in dns-route53. If \"--route53-base-domain base.com\" is given as option, the DNS records for \"_acme-challenge.example.com\" are updated / deleted under \"_acme-challenge.example.com.base.com\". By default, --route53-base-domain defaults to None and has no effect.\r\n\r\nThis comes in handy for automatically handling DNS challenges for wildcard certificates for domains that are hosted with providers that do not offer an API to update DNS records, but still allow DNS records like CNAME or NS to be configured through a web application. It also helps for just using a single zone in Route 53 when you need to handle multiple domains.\r\n\r\nThe basic approach is to delegate a subdomain like \"certbot.example.com\" from your hosting provider to AWS Route 53, adding NS records at your hosting provider to point to a zone defined by a SOA record at AWS Route 53. You can then add a static CNAME record for \"_acme-challenges.example.com\" at your hosting provider which points to a (not yet existing) \"_acme-challenges.example.com.certbot.example.com\" at Route 53, and finally use certbot configured for Route 53 with the option \"--route53-base-domain certbot.example.com\" to handle the dynamic part.

PR implements a mechanism to make Certbot for Windows update itself during the scheduled renew task run twice a day. \r\n\r\nTechnically this PR blocks on the signature of the installer executables, but all of this will be added soon, so we can start the review. \r\n\r\nThe mechanism is written into pure Powershell. I did that for the following reasons:\r\n* other programs in the wild usually use an approach of a dedicated executable outside the program itself\r\n* because Windows is Windows, it is just impossible for a program to self update: any opened file descriptor could block the process. So at least a part of the logic needs to be outside Certbot. Some can be in it (like checking new version availability, downloading the installer), but it was a minor part, and having the logic splitted in two different languages would decrease the maintainability in my opinion\r\n* Powershell includes all high level features required to make the script short and readable\r\n* `exec` Linux style is not possible on Windows, so a process (like Certbot) cannot transform itself into another process (like the upgrade mechanism), so a wrapper on top of Certbot would be required. With the limitations of Windows I do not think it would make something very elegant. \r\n* this way the mechanism can be plugged freely anywhere. I think it is relevant to associate it to the scheduled renew task, to avoid to break it if the upgrade would happen in parallel to `certbot renew` call. Here it is not possible, because the renew and the upgrade are called sequentially one after the other. \r\n\r\nAs said, the upgrade script is plugged into a specific action in the existing scheduled task. Actions in a task are run sequentially by construction. Also, it is not the script itself that is run, but a copy of it outside Certbot install directory, here again to avoid errors when trying to delete an open file during the upgrade. \r\n\r\nThe script itself will:\r\n* get current version of Certbot installed locally\r\n* get remote latest version using the Github API\r\n* download if necessary the installer of this new version\r\n* check it is signed correctly\r\n* check it is signed by us\r\n* run the installer in silent mode, using the original installation directory specified by the user when Certbot has been installed the first time\r\n\r\nPotential improvements : check that Certbot is effectively installed with the new version, fallback to previous version otherwise.
