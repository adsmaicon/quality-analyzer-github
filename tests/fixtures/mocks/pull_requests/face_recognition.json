changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>21.1 (2021-04-24)</h1>\n<h2>Process</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Start installation scheme migration from <code>distutils</code> to <code>sysconfig</code>. A\nwarning is implemented to detect differences between the two implementations to\nencourage user reports, so we can avoid breakages before they happen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add the ability for the new resolver to process URL constraints. (<code>[#8253](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8253) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8253&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Add a feature <code>--use-feature=in-tree-build</code> to build local projects in-place\nwhen installing. This is expected to become the default behavior in pip 21.3;\nsee <code>Installing from local packages &lt;https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#installing-from-local-packages&gt;</code>_\nfor more information. (<code>[#9091](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9091) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9091&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Bring back the &quot;(from versions: ...)&quot; message, that was shown on resolution failures. (<code>[#9139](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9139) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9139&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Add support for editable installs for project with only setup.cfg files. (<code>[#9547](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9547) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9547&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Improve performance when picking the best file from indexes during <code>pip install</code>. (<code>[#9748](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9748) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9748&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Warn instead of erroring out when doing a PEP 517 build in presence of\n<code>--build-option</code>. Warn when doing a PEP 517 build in presence of\n<code>--global-option</code>. (<code>[#9774](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9774) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9774&gt;</code>_)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed <code>--target</code> to work with <code>--editable</code> installs. (<code>[#4390](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4390) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4390&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Add a warning, discouraging the usage of pip as root, outside a virtual environment. (<code>[#6409](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6409) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6409&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Ignore <code>.dist-info</code> directories if the stem is not a valid Python distribution\nname, so they don't show up in e.g. <code>pip freeze</code>. (<code>[#7269](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7269) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7269&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Only query the keyring for URLs that actually trigger error 401.\nThis prevents an unnecessary keyring unlock prompt on every pip install\ninvocation (even with default index URL which is not password protected). (<code>[#8090](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8090) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8090&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Prevent packages already-installed alongside with pip to be injected into an\nisolated build environment during build-time dependency population. (<code>[#8214](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8214) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8214&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Fix <code>pip freeze</code> permission denied error in order to display an understandable error message and offer solutions. (<code>[#8418](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8418) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8418&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Correctly uninstall script files (from setuptools' <code>scripts</code> argument), when installed with <code>--user</code>. (<code>[#8733](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8733) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8733&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>New resolver: When a requirement is requested both via a direct URL\n(<code>req @ URL</code>) and via version specifier with extras (<code>req[extra]</code>), the\nresolver will now be able to use the URL to correctly resolve the requirement\nwith extras. (<code>[#8785](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8785) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8785&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>New resolver: Show relevant entries from user-supplied constraint files in the\nerror message to improve debuggability. (<code>[#9300](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9300) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9300&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Avoid parsing version to make the version check more robust against lousily\ndebundled downstream distributions. (<code>[#9348](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9348) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9348&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li><code>--user</code> is no longer suggested incorrectly when pip fails with a permission\nerror in a virtual environment.

PR adds the functionality to be able to load images directly from a URL and also allows for reading a base64 image. Primary motivation for creation of this feature is with the extensive online work being done, it is easier to have an all-in-one solution than to have a user import another library and have additional code unrelated to the user's use case.  \r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Support to load base 64 images\r\n- Support to directly load online images\r\n\r\n## Code Examples\r\n### Online Images\r\n```\r\nimport face-recognition\r\nimage = load_image_online(r'https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/tests/test_images/obama.jpg?raw=true')\r\nface_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Base64 Image\r\n```\r\nimport face-recognition\r\nimage = load_image_file(base64_string, base64_image=True)\r\nface_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n- [X] docstring in function\r\n- [X] flake8 formatting check\r\n- [X] Added Tests for features\r\n- [x] Github Actions all tests

It can be easily solved by rotating the image according to EXIF after loading. \r\nPIL already has a method `PIL.ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)` to do this. Which will apply EXIF transform if required.\r\n\r\n**What I did:**\r\nRotate the image according to EXIF after loading it before doing anything.
