SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWith the free strategy, the last task name should not be cached. Ref: #43950\r\n\r\nHowever, the same might be true of a strategy plugin, a popular example being\r\nmitogen_free. Otherwise, task names will be incorrect for mitogen_free just\r\nlike in #43950\r\n\r\nRather than checking for the name of the strategy in the callback plugin, we\r\ncan query the strategy itself whether task names should be cached or not.\r\n\r\nSince the strategy is not available directly from the callback, passing a flag\r\non the play object via v2_playbook_on_play_start. A play has only one strategy.\r\n\r\n##### ISSUE TYPE\r\n<!--- Pick one below and delete the rest -->\r\n- Bugfix Pull Request\r\n\r\n##### COMPONENT NAME\r\ndefault callback / free strategy\r\n\r\n##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Include additional information to help people understand the change here -->\r\n<!--- A step-by-step reproduction of the problem is helpful if there is no related issue -->\r\n\r\n<!--- Paste verbatim command output below, e.g. before and after your change -->\r\n```paste below\r\n\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-16T16:32:03Z","updated_at":"2022-03-29T21:25:30Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a0a1b05c9a6b1acb855c87b9803704874dcff32a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":61436281,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MTQzNjI4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/labels/needs_revision","name":"needs_revision","color":"eb6450","default":false,"description":"This PR fails CI tests or a maintainer has requested a review/revision of the PR."},{"id":581543918,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODE1NDM5MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/labels/stale_ci","name":"stale_ci","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":"This PR has been tested by CI more than one week ago.

SUMMARY\r\nThis is a new facts module extending basic facts with detailed system information.\r\n\r\nThe module `system_facts` is an ansible wrapper of `psutil` python module and the subset names and related parameters of this module matches to major part of `psutil` functions. \r\n\r\n##### ISSUE TYPE\r\n- Feature Pull Request\r\n\r\n##### COMPONENT NAME\r\nsystem_facts\r\n\r\n##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\nThe aim is to put in place a new facts module gathering additional informations about server parameters and states. As mentioned in the summary, this module wraps the `psutil` python module, but it could be great to extend it with the maximum of several parameters not included in gather_facts module. Typically the content of many system configuration files (for example as already implemented for `resolv.conf`)  could be implemented too. \r\nThe most important is to use lightweight python functions and avoid the shell calls for the performance reasons. That's why the subset choices makes the sense if you want to call this module repetitively to get for example a list of running processes.  \r\n<!--- Include additional information to help people understand the change here -->\r\n<!--- A step-by-step reproduction of the problem is helpful if there is no related issue -->\r\nTested on:\r\n- RHEL 8.3\r\n- Debian 10\r\n<!--- Paste verbatim command output below, e.g. before and after your change -->\r\n```\r\n# Return all system facts\r\n- name: Get all system facts\r\n  ansible.builtin.system_facts:\r\n\r\n# Returns only cpu_percent and cpu_times subsets\r\n- name: Get CPU metrics\r\n  ansible.builtin.system_facts:\r\n    subsets:\r\n      - cpu_percent\r\n      - cpu_times\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-15T10:16:02Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T18:41:12Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8075d2235e36bf6699ad57b850db7e071707be18","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":61436281,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MTQzNjI4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/labels/needs_revision","name":"needs_revision","color":"eb6450","default":false,"description":"This PR fails CI tests or a maintainer has requested a review/revision of the PR."},{"id":153577825,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTM1Nzc4MjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/labels/new_plugin","name":"new_plugin","color":"bfe5bf","default":false,"description":"This PR includes a new plugin."},{"id":231201931,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzEyMDE5MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/labels/needs_rebase","name":"needs_rebase","color":"eb6420","default":false,"description":"https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_rebasing.html"},{"id":473225334,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0NzMyMjUzMzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/labels/new_module","name":"new_module","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"This PR includes a new module."},{"id":496359346,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTYzNTkzNDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/labels/module","name":"module","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"This issue/PR relates to a module."},{"id":581543918,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODE1NDM5MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/labels/stale_ci","name":"stale_ci","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":"This PR has been tested by CI more than one week ago.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPossible solution for #77059.\r\n\r\nThis adds a new `action_plugin` routing field for modules to support modules that need to use a common action plugin but don't want module_defaults resolved to the action plugin.\r\n\r\nInstead of hijacking the action plugin redirection to ensure a platform-specific handler is used for a module:\r\n\r\n```\r\nplugin_routing:\r\n  action:\r\n    somemodule:  # Was never an action plugin, just here to replicate platform_somemodule prefix magic for determining the action plugin\r\n      redirect: testns.testcoll.platform\r\n  modules:\r\n    somemodule:\r\n      redirect: testns.testcoll.platform_somemodule\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resolved module can specify an action plugin directly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nplugin_routing:\r\n  modules:\r\n
