issue details page is overwhelming and cramped today. Also, we’ve consistently heard feedback from new customers that they don’t know what the Issue ID is. So this PR does the following:\r\n\r\n- adds breadcrumbs to the issue details page which makes it much more obvious what the ID is\r\n- removes a ton of bananas css and old bootstrap stuff\r\n- fixes layout of the header at smaller sizes\r\n- makes things more consistent by using our Layout

this is a weird problem. It looks like when we're asynchronously updating the `input_channel_id` for a _Slack_ `AlertRuleTriggerAction`, we're seeing serialization errors in other parts of the AlertRule.\r\n\r\nThis PR will fix the problem in this case by always removing the `sentry_app_installation_uuid` field during validation, but a longer term fix would be to prevent a `AlertRuleTriggerAction` of type `SentryApp` from being incorrectly saved without `sentry_app_config`.\r\n\r\nFixes

here:\r\nhttps://github.com/getsentry/getsentry/pull/7266\r\n\r\nThe payload size is limited by a parameter set in each category.
