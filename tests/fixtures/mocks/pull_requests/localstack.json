test](https://github.com/RodrigoATorres/localstack/blob/feature/lambda_unzip_max_size/tests/integration/awslambda/test_lambda_size_lims.py). When running against localstack, the test with the over-sized zip file does not pass. But it passes when running with TEST_TARGET=\"AWS_CLOUD\".\r\n\r\nWhat this test does is generate a python file with a size greater than the limit, compress it, save to s3, and try to create a lambda function using it. The lambda api should not allow the function to be created.\r\n\r\n# Fix\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, a check on the unzipped code size was added to the \"do_set_function_code\" function. If size is greater than the limit, a exception is raised\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-09T18:16:25Z","updated_at":"2022-03-31T18:30:27Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa82601b89bfa0894cd363212c25548c6f69fe17","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dominikschubert","id":620817,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMDgxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/620817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikschubert","html_url":"https://github.com/dominikschubert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikschubert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikschubert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikschubert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikschubert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikschubert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikschubert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikschubert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikschubert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikschubert/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"dfangl","id":16599060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTk5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16599060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfangl","html_url":"https://github.com/dfangl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfangl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfangl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfangl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfangl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfangl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfangl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfangl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfangl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfangl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/5641/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/5641/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/5641/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/statuses/77364651f8dee44b0aa52deb3132df690a152d13","head":{"label":"RodrigoATorres:feature/lambda_unzip_max_size","ref":"feature/lambda_unzip_max_size","sha":"77364651f8dee44b0aa52deb3132df690a152d13","user":{"login":"RodrigoATorres","id":13500431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTAwNDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13500431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres","html_url":"https://github.com/RodrigoATorres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":467281538,"node_id":"R_kgDOG9omgg","name":"localstack","full_name":"RodrigoATorres/localstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RodrigoATorres","id":13500431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTAwNDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13500431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres","html_url":"https://github.com/RodrigoATorres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RodrigoATorres/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RodrigoATorres/localstack","description":"ðŸ’»

is an experimental PR that enables mocked responses for any AWS service. The framework can generate random instances of AWS shapes, including requests and responses. This can be used for generating random but valid responses for services that have not been implemented.\r\nAdditionally, it can be used to generate test cases for both parser and serializer. Using randomly generated requests, I was able to somewhat generalize the logic that determines the AWS service from the request.","created_at":"2022-02-27T20:59:25Z","updated_at":"2022-02-27T21:08:54Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3ecfc0126b3002610070fe20ff7e3aca95914863","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/5581/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/5581/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/5581/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/statuses/6b19d43c36a6d9a8fe13d5a522e0e72fc214b580","head":{"label":"localstack:asf-mocking","ref":"asf-mocking","sha":"6b19d43c36a6d9a8fe13d5a522e0e72fc214b580","user":{"login":"localstack","id":28732122,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI4NzMyMTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28732122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack","html_url":"https://github.com/localstack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":71948498,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MTk0ODQ5OA==","name":"localstack","full_name":"localstack/localstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"localstack","id":28732122,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI4NzMyMTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28732122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack","html_url":"https://github.com/localstack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/localstack/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/localstack/localstack","description":"ðŸ’»  A fully functional local AWS cloud stack.

TODO\r\n- [ ] Implement new HTTP request handling (while not breaking the previous functionality).\r\n- [ ] Migrate current features of the edge proxy (service detection,...) into separate handlers.\r\n- [ ] Fix all integration tests with the new request handling enabled.\r\n- [ ] Hide the new functionality behind a feature flag

following issues are corrected:\n\n\n* windows paths are injected into the bash scripts (fixed by converting to linux paths)\n* commands passed into bash on windows must be enclosed in quotes\n* Process.waitFor() not working as expected on Windows (with embedded Linux)\n* reading the output streams from bash running in the java process problematic, leading to the following adjustments:\n  * process.waitFor() changed to process.waitFor(timeout) with suitable timeouts selected based on empirical data\n  * workarounds for all the stream reads put in place\n\nAlso added additional helpful logging/output which will assist Windows users in troubleshooting.\n\nTested on Windows 10 using the Linux Subsystem for Windows.
