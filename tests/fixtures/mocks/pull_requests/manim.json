The result could be unexpected due to spaces, ligatures, and fancy mobjects brought by markup tags. So I referred to the idea of `MTex` and refactored these classes.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, `MarkupText` and `MTex` both inherit `LabelledString` class, so they share many similarities. `Text` is an alias of `MarkupText`, with the only exception that the attribute `is_markup` is default to be `False`. `apply_space_chars` and `disable_ligatures` attributes are removed.\r\n\r\nSome noticeable features about `LabelledString`:\r\n- Still maintains the original svg structure (no additional hierarchies);\r\n- Has an `isolate` attribute to add substrings to break up;\r\n- Has a `base_color` attribute to specify the default color (default `WHITE`);\r\n- Supports methods including `get_parts_by_string`, `get_part_by_string`, `set_color_by_string`, `set_color_by_string_to_color_map` (in `MTex`, aliases like `get_parts_by_tex` are supported; in `Text` and `MarkupText`, aliases like `get_parts_by_text` are supported);\r\n- Supports `TransformMatchingStrings`, `AddTextWordByWord` animations.\r\n\r\nThe substring selecting logic is improved so that strings can be matched more easily:\r\n```python\r\ntex = MTex(\"3 \\\\sqrt{2}\", isolate=[\"\\\\sqrt{2}\"])\r\ntex.set_color_by_tex(\"sqrt\", ORANGE)\r\nself.add(tex)\r\n```\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Result</summary>\r\n\r\n![StringTest0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50232075/160865079-d2469e8e-0bce-427f-a464-0ecf3ed380a5.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nBy default, the string passed into `Text` is chopped into substrings at the following indices:\r\n> Boundaries of words (a.k.a. `r\"\\b\"`),\r\n> Bounderies of continuous spaces (a.k.a. `r\"\\s+\"`),\r\n> Boundaries of markup commands.\r\n\r\nSo there'll be no problem if one runs the following:\r\n```python\r\ntext = Text(\"Hello text\", base_color=TEAL)\r\ntext.set_color_by_text(\"text\", ORANGE)\r\nself.add(text)\r\n```\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Result</summary>\r\n\r\n![StringTest1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50232075/160866375-db8087f3-042b-4c76-9524-82f1e9a00cd9.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nBut if the second line is replaced with `text.set_color_by_text(\"tex\", ORANGE)`, still the entire `\"text\"` will be colored. If you need to color `\"tex\"` only, you may specify `isolate=[\"tex\"]`:\r\n```python\r\ntext = Text(\"Hello text\", isolate=[\"tex\"], base_color=TEAL)\r\ntext.set_color_by_text(\"tex\",

This pull request gives SVGMobjects rudimentary support for gradient fills, just enough to extract the basic color & opacity information, so that an SVG with gradient fills is still often usable.   \r\nBroader Motivation: Noto emoji use gradient fills. Noto emoji are world-class quality and have the most generous license, so it would be nice to use them in manim.  Please envision with me, emoji have such depth of meaning as they are on everyone's phone & pervasively used.  Imagine in the future there is a simple class in drawings.py, Emojimob, where the user can quickly and conveniently specify an emoji shortcode (its name), and manim returns the emoji graphic as an SVGMobject. What a world of expression would be opened up. If a mathematical formula is wrong, we put the `:prohibited:` :no_entry_sign:  emoji or `:skull_and_crossbones:` :skull_and_crossbones: on it. If a formula is right, we could display a `:star:` :star: or a `:100:` :100:. If a formula is too complicated, :poop:. Users could make their own substitute for pi creatures simply by using an emoji smiley as a head, and all the variants to show their emotions.  If a picture is worth a thousand words, emoji step that up a notch because they bring so much extra implicit meaning. We prefer SVG to PNG because of the arbitrary scaling and the ability to manipulate submobjects (eg smiley face, animate its eyebrow raising).  Adding basic support for gradient fills is a big step toward making the Noto Emoji usable within manim.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n<!-- What you changed in those files -->\r\nWe propose to capture the SVG's gradient fill information and give it to the SVGMobject.  Manim itself already has some support for linear gradient fills, so all we do is tell manim about the SVG's gradients and manim will use them as best it can. \r\nThe pull request is 10 lines of code - could be made more robust however this code is deactivated by default, so nothing can break unless the user asks for it.\r\n\r\n## Test\r\n<!-- How do you test your changes -->\r\n**Code**:\r\nHere is a Scene that downloads two Noto emoji SVG from the Noto github and displays them, \"before\" and \"after\" style.  Since the user must actively choose the new gradient fill logic, we can implement 'before' and 'after' just by using the CONFIG option `'gradient_fills: True'` that we send to SVGMobject.\r\n\r\nThe variable `filnms` is setup with a hardcode of two representative emoji.  For a limitless smorgasbord of emoji, uncomment the lines at the top to download the entire emoji dictionary, parse it, and store it into `filnms` (also commenting out the other `filnms`)\r\n```\r\nfrom manimlib import *\r\n\r\n#for even more fun, uncomment to get the entire dictionary of every emoji (comment the other one)\r\n#\r\n#import json\r\n#from urllib.request import urlopen\r\n#emjdat = urlopen(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googlefonts/emoji-metadata/main/emoji_14_0_ordering.json\")\r\n#filnms = [{\"alias\":alias,\"filnm\": 'emoji_u'+ \"_\".join(filter(None,[ format(x,'04x').replace('fe0f','') for x in codes]))} for alias,codes in [('  '.join(emj[\"shortcodes\"]),altbas) for grp in json.load(emjdat) if grp[\"group\"] != \"Flags\" for emj in grp[\"emoji\"] if emj[\"shortcodes\"] not in [[':foot:']] for altbas in emj[\"alternates\"] or [emj[\"base\"]] ] ]\r\n\r\n#Or, just specify a couple of emoji to test\r\n# these two highlight the improvement from the new code\r\n#\r\nfilnms = [ {\"filnm\":\"emoji_u1f633\",\"alias\":\"flushed face\"} ,{\"filnm\":\"emoji_u1f56f\",\"alias\":\"candle\"} ]\r\n\r\n#Where to get the emoji SVG\r\n# automatically download from internet on the fly (slow) \r\n# or point to a local dir of them that you downloaded previously\r\n#\r\n#noto_url = \"noto/\"\r\nnoto_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/main/\"\r\n\r\n############################\r\n#Current SVGMobject: no changes/no gradients since the new code is not used by default\r\n############################\r\nclass Emojiold(SVGMobject):\r\n  CONFIG = { \"svg_default\": { \"stroke_width\": 0.0 } }\r\n  def __init__(self, **kwargs):\r\n    SVGMobject.__init__(self, **kwargs)\r\n\r\n############################\r\n#New Gradient Fills: user must actively choose with config \"gradient_fills\"\r\n############################\r\nclass Emojinew(SVGMobject):\r\n  CONFIG = { \"svg_default\": { \"stroke_width\": 0.0 }, \"gradient_fills\": True}\r\n  def __init__(self, **kwargs):\r\n    SVGMobject.__init__(self,  **kwargs)\r\n\r\n############################\r\n#Scene\r\n############################\r\nclass GradientTest(Scene):\r\n  def construct(self):\r\n    for emoji in filnms:\r\n      self.clear()\r\n      oldemj = Emojiold(file_name=noto_url+\"svg/\"+emoji[\"filnm\"]+\".svg\").scale(2).shift(LEFT*3.5)\r\n      newemj = Emojinew(file_name=noto_url+\"svg/\"+emoji[\"filnm\"]+\".svg\").scale(2).shift(RIGHT*3.5)\r\n      self.add(ComplexPlane(), oldemj, newemj,\r\n               Text(emoji[\"filnm\"]).to_edge(UP+LEFT), Text(emoji[\"alias\"]).to_edge(DOWN+LEFT),\r\n               Text(\"OLD\").next_to(oldemj,DOWN),Text(\"NEW\").next_to(newemj,DOWN))\r\n      self.wait(5/self.camera.frame_rate)  # 5 frames each\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Result**:\r\nI tested using most every Noto emoji (a few thousand). This new logic turns most of the unusable Noto emoji into usable, and nothing breaks.  Note `:foot:` :foot: is the one single Noto emoji SVG that breaks manim, whether using old logic or new (nothing to do with gradient fills) and so I omitted it.  I also omitted country flags because they would need some additional twisting to bring in, and many are broken anyway (both old and new, nothing to do with gradient fills).  I consider these (and other) issues in scope for a different, future topic.\r\nBelow are manim videos of all these, 'before' and 'after' style. Looking at the 'afters', this change gets the vast majority of Noto emoji to some level of usability, and it's a nice way for other improvements to suggest themselves for SVGMobject in the future. If we get to step 1, I could see it leading to community interest in helping with those too.\r\nDue to 10mb size limitation I had to make 1 frame per each emoji & split into two files. Hopefully there is a way to step frame-by-frame or you have gaming quality reaction times.\r\n**Every Noto Emoji
