cachetools\r\n\r\nThe [cachetools](https://cachetools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) module provides various memoizing collections and decorators, including variants of the Python Standard Library’s [@lru_cache](http://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache) function decorator.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this module, a cache is a [mutable](http://docs.python.org/dev/glossary.html#term-mutable) [mapping](http://docs.python.org/dev/glossary.html#term-mapping) of a fixed maximum size. When the cache is full, i.e. by adding another item the cache would exceed its maximum size, the cache must choose which item(s) to discard based on a suitable [cache algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms).\r\n\r\nThis module provides multiple cache classes based on different cache algorithms, as well as decorators for easily memoizing function and method calls.\r\n\r\n## What's the difference between this Python project and similar ones?\r\n\r\nThis module provides many useful variants and extensions of the Python Standard Library’s

What is this Python project?\r\n\r\n`databooks` is a package to ease the collaboration between data scientists using [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), by reducing the number of git conflicts between different notebooks and resolution of git conflicts when encountered.\r\n\r\nThe key features include:\r\n\r\n- CLI tool\r\n  - Clear notebook metadata\r\n  - Resolve git conflicts\r\n- Simple to use\r\n- Simple API for using modelling and comparing notebooks using [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## What's the difference between this Python project and similar ones?\r\n\r\n- [nb-clean](https://github.com/srstevenson/nb-clean): helps clear notebook metadata, but only that, so more limited in scope compared to databooks.\r\n- [nbdime](https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime): helps with diffs and merges of notebooks, however, databooks supports a way to resolve existing conflicts, which is not supported by nbdime.\r\n- [nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev): nbdev provides an opinionated template for developing packages with notebooks, databooks is a configurable CLI tool that you can use in whatever way you prefer.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAnyone who agrees with this pull request could submit an *Approve* review to it.\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-15T08:46:32Z","updated_at":"2022-02-20T14:49:38Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"90793746a4df627df27b9f8f17e830d062fb2a80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vinta/awesome-python/pulls/1949/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vinta/awesome-python/pulls/1949/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vinta/awesome-python/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vinta/awesome-python/issues/1949/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vinta/awesome-python/statuses/4a1c7d66de13266508ddd6121e6849ee0439f79d","head":{"label":"frederikdesmedt:master","ref":"master","sha":"4a1c7d66de13266508ddd6121e6849ee0439f79d","user":{"login":"frederikdesmedt","id":6725858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MjU4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6725858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt","html_url":"https://github.com/frederikdesmedt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":459486876,"node_id":"R_kgDOG2M2nA","name":"awesome-python","full_name":"frederikdesmedt/awesome-python","private":false,"owner":{"login":"frederikdesmedt","id":6725858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MjU4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6725858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt","html_url":"https://github.com/frederikdesmedt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frederikdesmedt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/frederikdesmedt/awesome-python","description":"A

PR has several parts:\r\n1. Rename \"Geolocation\" to \"geospatial data processing\", since it's a more accurate description of what these libraries do.\r\n2. Create a new subcategory for the \"core\" libraries and frameworks that are used for data analysis in the Python ecosystem.\r\n3. Move or add many popular libraries for visuzaliation and [exploratory] data analysis (see below).\r\n\r\nAdded / moves libraries:\r\n1.

What is this Python project?\r\n\r\nRaylib is a simple library for videogames programming. This set of static bindings provides a fast and familier interface with the original Raylib 4.0 API. Genuinly suprised to not see any python-raylib bindings already, so I'd very much like to suggest this package be the one featured on this fantastic list.\r\n\r\n## What's the difference between this Python project and similar ones?\r\n\r\n- Automatically generated to be as close as possible to original Raylib.\r\n- Faster, fewer bugs and easier to maintain than ctypes.\r\n- Commercial-friendly license.\r\n-  Docstrings and auto-completion.\r\n- Now includes extra libraries: raygui, rlgl and physac\r\n--\r\n\r\nAnyone who agrees with this pull request could submit an *Approve* review to

About P2PNetwork\r\n\r\nlibp2p is a networking stack and library modularized out of The IPFS Project, and bundled separately for other tools to use.\r\n\r\nlibp2p is the product of a long, and arduous quest of understanding -- a deep dive into the internet's network stack, and plentiful peer-to-peer protocols from the past. Building large-scale peer-to-peer systems has been complex and difficult in the last 15 years, and libp2p is a way to fix that. It is a \"network stack\" -- a protocol suite -- that cleanly separates concerns, and enables sophisticated applications to only use the protocols they absolutely need, without giving up interoperability and upgradeability. libp2p grew out of IPFS, but it is built so that lots of people can use it, for lots of different projects. [More](https://libp2p.io/)\r\n\r\n## About Multiaddr\r\n\r\nMultiaddr aims to make network addresses future-proof, composable, and efficient.\r\n\r\nCurrent addressing schemes have a number of problems.\r\n\r\nThey hinder protocol migrations and interoperability between protocols.\r\nThey don't compose well. There are plenty of X-over-Y constructions, but only few of them can be addressed in a classic URI/URL or host:port scheme.\r\nThey don't multiplex: they address ports, not processes.\r\nThey're implicit, in that they presume out-of-band values and context.\r\nThey don't have efficient machine-readable representations.\r\nMultiaddr solves these problems by modelling network addresses as arbitrary encapsulations of protocols.\r\n\r\nMultiaddrs support addresses for any network protocol.\r\nMultiaddrs are self-describing.\r\nMultiaddrs conform to a simple syntax, making them trivial to parse and construct.\r\nMultiaddrs have human-readable and efficient machine-readable representations.\r\nMultiaddrs encapsulate well, allowing trivial wrapping and unwrapping of encapsulation layers. [More](https://multiformats.io/multiaddr/)\r\n\r\n## About Multihash\r\n\r\nMultihash is a protocol for differentiating outputs from various well-established hash functions, addressing size + encoding considerations. It is useful to write applications that future-proof their use of hashes, and allow multiple hash functions to coexist.\r\n\r\nMultihash is particularly important in systems which depend on cryptographically secure hash functions. Attacks may break the cryptographic properties of secure hash functions. These cryptographic breaks are particularly painful in large tool ecosystems, where tools may have made assumptions about hash values, such as function and digest size. Upgrading becomes a nightmare, as all tools which make those assumptions would have to be upgraded to use the new hash function and new hash digest length. Tools may face serious interoperability problems or error-prone special casing.

What is this Python project?\r\n\r\nSometimes it's very hard to find if some large files are eating up the system storage. We always need to detect these and takes actions afterwards. But in bigger file system it's challenging enough to filter through thousands and millions of files. This CLI application helps to find those giant files that are eating up your system storage with lot of filtering options and faster result.\r\n\r\n## What's the difference between this Python project and similar ones?\r\n\r\n- Faster result\r\n- Works on huge file storage\r\n- Lot of filtering capabilities\r\n- No dependency overhead \r\n- easy to install and operate\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAnyone who
