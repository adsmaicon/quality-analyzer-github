It would be convenient to have a wrapper that adds this functionality. It's not that hard to add this feature yourself, but if you don't use PyGame for rendering in the first place, it may be *a lot* of boilerplate code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf someone thinks that this might be a good idea, I will start adding documentation and tests if necessary. Not sure whether I'm missing something, but this seems like a wrapper that could be quite useful (at least I will be using it personally).","created_at":"2022-03-25T15:16:33Z","updated_at":"2022-03-25T17:21:16Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54dafc2ce01c4a8c1d63b33777dcc4d533b37aa0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openai/gym/pulls/2719/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openai/gym/pulls/2719/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openai/gym/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openai/gym/issues/2719/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openai/gym/statuses/395bd533c3e37c9255d362e69320c113b3b8a8b4","head":{"label":"Markus28:human_render_wrapper","ref":"human_render_wrapper","sha":"395bd533c3e37c9255d362e69320c113b3b8a8b4","user":{"login":"Markus28","id":15806078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2MDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15806078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28","html_url":"https://github.com/Markus28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":441653024,"node_id":"R_kgDOGlMXIA","name":"gym","full_name":"Markus28/gym","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Markus28","id":15806078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2MDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15806078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28","html_url":"https://github.com/Markus28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Markus28/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Markus28/gym","description":"A

New render API\r\nFollowing this discussion: #2540\r\n\r\nThis PR changes eliminates the `render()` method in favor of `collect_render()`.\r\nThe `render_mode` is specified during the instantiation of the environment; the environment handles internally the rendering.\r\nIn case `render_mode = \"human\"`, the method `collect_render()` return `self.isopen` if there the environment use some resources that should be closed or simply `None`.\r\nWith other render modes, `collect_render()` returns a proper `List` with all the renders from the last `reset()`. For example, with `render_mode = \"rgb_array\"`, `collect_render()` returns a `List` of `np.ndarray`, while with `render_mode = \"ansi\"` a `List[str]`.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport gym\r\n\r\nenv = gym.make('FrozenLake-v1')  # default: render_mode=\"human\"\r\nenv.reset()\r\nfor _ in range(100):\r\n    env.step(env.action_space.sample())\r\n    \r\nenv.collect_render()\r\n>

PR adds a new feature that makes the gym spaces a lot more expressive: **Filtered** spaces!\r\n\r\nThere are 3 components in this PR:\r\n- `SpaceWrapper` (in `gym/spaces/other/wrapper.py`):\r\n    - Same idea as `gym.Wrapper`, but for spaces! This can serve as the basis for a bunch of cool adapters for gym spaces in the future! For example, something like a `TensorSpaceWrapper`, that converts the samples to/from Tensors in the `sample` and `contains`, respectively.\r\n- `FilteredSpace`  (in `gym/spaces/other/filter.py`):\r\n    - Adds assumptions (predicates) to a space, limiting the samples that are considered valid.\r\n    - Uses rejection sampling with a maximum of `max_sampling_attempts` attempts.\r\n- `Space.where(predicate)`:\r\n    - Adds filters to the space, returning a `SpaceWrapper`.\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from gym.spaces import Discrete, Box, Space\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n\r\n>>> odd_digits = Discrete(10, seed=123).where(lambda n: n % 2 == 1)\r\n>>> 1 in odd_digits\r\nTrue\r\n>>> 2 in odd_digits\r\nFalse\r\n>>> odd_digits.sample()\r\n5\r\n```\r\nOther cool examples:\r\n```python\r\n>>> unit_circle = Box(-1, 1, shape=(2,), dtype=np.float64, seed=123).where(lambda xy: (xy ** 2).sum() <= 1)\r\n>>> np.array((0.1, 0.2)) in unit_circle\r\nTrue\r\n>>> np.array((1, 1)) in unit_circle\r\nFalse\r\n>>> unit_circle.sample()\r\narray([ 0.36470373, -0.89235796])\r\n\r\n>>> def hypersphere(radius: float, dimensions: int) -> FilteredSpace[np.ndarray]:\r\n...     return Box(-radius, +radius, shape=(dimensions,)).where(\r\n...         lambda v: v.pow(2).sum() <= radius**dimensions\r\n...     )\r\n...\r\n>>> unit_sphere = hypersphere(radius=1,

for the nesting of Async/Sync VectorEnvs\r\n\r\n- 2-level nesting of any combination of SyncVectorEnv/AsyncVectorEnv  (i.e. Sync/Sync, Sync/Async, Async/Sync, Async/Async*)\r\n - Tested with the \"CubeCrash-v0\" and \"CartPole-v0\" environments\r\n\r\n*: When nesting Async/Async environments, only the innermost env can have `daemon=True`, since daemonic processes cannot have children.\r\n\r\nSomewhat related to #2072 (based on a suggestion from @tristandeleu ). A new Wrapper could also be eventually be introduced in another PR to \"unchunk\" the observations/actions/rewards/dones, (flatten the first two batch dimensions).\r\n\r\nThere currently aren't any tests specifically about the handling of Tuple/Dict/non-standard observation/action spaces.

the following features, compared to using the vectorized Async and Sync\r\nVectorEnvs:\r\n\r\n-   Chunking: Running more than one environment per worker. This is done by\r\n    passing `SyncVectorEnv`s as the env_fns to the `AsyncVectorEnv`.\r\n\r\n-   Flexible batch size: Supports any number of environments, irrespective\r\n    of the number of workers or of CPUs. The number of environments will be\r\n    spread out as equally as possible between the workers.\r\n\r\n    For example, if you want to have a batch_size of 17, and n_workers is 6,\r\n    then the number of environments per worker will be: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2].\r\n\r\n    Internally, this works by creating up to two AsyncVectorEnvs, env_a and\r\n    env_b. If the number of envs (batch_size) isn't a multiple of the number\r\n    of workers, then we create the second AsyncVectorEnv (env_b).\r\n\r\n    In the first environment (env_a), each env will contain\r\n    ceil(n_envs / n_workers) each. If env_b is needed, then each of its envs\r\n    will contain floor(n_envs / n_workers) environments.\r\n\r\n    The observations/actions/rewards are reshaped to be (n_envs, *shape), i.e.\r\n    they don't have an extra 'chunk' dimension.\r\n\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Fabrice Normandin
