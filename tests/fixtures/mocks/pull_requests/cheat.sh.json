portability fans are back! :-)\r\n\r\nThere were a few things broken already. In particular, a few places had \"$foo\" instead of $foo, breaking the intended words expansion.\r\n\r\nThe bash arrays were replaced with either simple expansion, or written directly, resulting in no code quality loss.\r\n\r\nThe zsh bits are only needed if someone will ever run \"zsh cht.sh\" and could be dropped; when zsh is working as sh, the shwordsplit option gets set automatically.\r\n\r\nThe local/typeset/declare case is the most complicated one. Technically, POSIX just reserves \"local\", \"typeset\" and \"declare\" for use by shell, keeping them as undefined behavior. All the shells I've tested with (bash, dash, ksh93, OpenBSD ksh, zsh) support either \"local\" or \"typeset\" command. But for better compatibility sakeness, since it was meaningful enough for 884161c4c7a3ccf6eb4c6ed226ed1104b49614ef, the \"eval\" fallback was implemented. This makes \"local foo\" invalid, thought, so I had to replace all of them with \"local foo=\" instead. But the better option likely be just ignoring shells that do not support local-scoped variables, since the code is likely to break in this case anyway.","created_at":"2020-10-03T17:03:39Z","updated_at":"2021-11-17T22:27:08Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"941baf78c4229cc475755e8e32ac9ce7d08341b6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chubin/cheat.sh/pulls/237/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chubin/cheat.sh/pulls/237/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chubin/cheat.sh/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chubin/cheat.sh/issues/237/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chubin/cheat.sh/statuses/cb0439b625bd7b2e9777662ceb71c7106f75f654","head":{"label":"grayed:posix_sh","ref":"posix_sh","sha":"cb0439b625bd7b2e9777662ceb71c7106f75f654","user":{"login":"grayed","id":892006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MjAwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/892006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed","html_url":"https://github.com/grayed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":140462910,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDA0NjI5MTA=","name":"cheat.sh","full_name":"grayed/cheat.sh","private":false,"owner":{"login":"grayed","id":892006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MjAwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/892006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed","html_url":"https://github.com/grayed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grayed/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/grayed/cheat.sh","description":"the
