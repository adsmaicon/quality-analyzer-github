The issue was that fmt skip comments were being handled inconsistently. A formatted version of the comment (e.g. `#fmt:skip` -> `# fmt:skip` in `comment.value`) was being compared to the original comment in the code (e.g. `#fmt:skip` in `leaf.prefix`), which would always be False.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there's anything I missed.

Aims to remove redundant parentheses from `with` statements:\r\n![Screen-Recording-2022-03-15-at-17 20

[tests/data/parenthesized_context_managers.py](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/main/tests/data/parenthesized_context_managers.py) since this code now removes unnecessary parentheses around one-line `with` statements, so think I'll just need to update the test to reflect this. \r\nI tried looking in the contributing docs but couldn't see any info on how the tests work so please could you advise on where I should add this?\r\n\r\nThis is my first time contributing to black so let me know if there's anything I've missed 😄 \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n- [X] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary?\r\n-

Description\r\n\r\nOne of the things discussed in issue #144 was quote placement. Reading through the discussion, there seemed (to me, at least) to be general support for normalising this.\r\n\r\nThis does two things. For very short docstrings,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Why is this on its own line?\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"Why is this on its own line?\"\"\"\r\n```\r\nand for docstrings of more than one line, a single newline at the start and (pre-indent) end are enforced, so\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"Words\r\n\r\n    More words\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    \r\n    Words\r\n\r\n    More words\r\n\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\nboth become\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Words\r\n\r\n    More words\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\nwhich seemed to be the more popular style (compared with having no newline line at the start) in the #144 thread.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, any docstring with only one line of content will be converted to the one-line form. This may be problematic if it is very long, but I'm not sure what the line-length limit should be if this were changed: the normal line length limit, or 72 characters as specified by PEP 8 (which I'm not sure actually applies to single-line docstrings), or something else?\r\n\r\nI changed some tests files where the docstring formatting didn’t seem relevant, so as not to have two copies of too many test files.\r\n\r\nI didn’t reformat Black’s own source code with this change. There are parts of Black’s source that are already affected by `--preview`, so maybe this should change at the same time.\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n- [x] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add new / update outdated documentation?\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-17T18:28:26Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T21:22:14Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b8bc0bada12c4427ab5b6e7a383694efb3a21346","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/pulls/2885/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/pulls/2885/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2885/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/statuses/e073b63d78744e63f4f522c75e29a0b09a7fc0a8","head":{"label":"TomFryers:main","ref":"main","sha":"e073b63d78744e63f4f522c75e29a0b09a7fc0a8","user":{"login":"TomFryers","id":61272761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMjcyNzYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61272761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers","html_url":"https://github.com/TomFryers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":395230068,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTUyMzAwNjg=","name":"black","full_name":"TomFryers/black","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TomFryers","id":61272761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMjcyNzYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61272761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers","html_url":"https://github.com/TomFryers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomFryers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TomFryers/black","description":"The

number of breaking improvements.</p>\n<p>Full Changelog: <a href=\"https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/compare/v0.16.1...v0.17.0\">v0.16.1...v0.17.0</a></p>\n<h3>‼️ Markdown link resolution improvements</h3>\n<p>Markdown links are of the format <code>[text](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/link)</code>.\nMyST-Parser looks to smartly resolve such links, by identifying if they are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A link to an external resource, e.g. <code>[text](http://example.com)</code></li>\n<li>A link to another source document, e.g. <code>[text](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/file.md)</code>\n<ul>\n<li>If <code>header-anchors</code> are enabled, anchor links are also supported, e.g. <code>[text](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/file.md#anchor)</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A link to an internal sphinx cross-reference, e.g. <code>[text](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/my-reference)</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>an additional situation is now supported:</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>A link to a source

introduces a style helper for styling your logs to get a bit *pretty* output in the terminal. \r\n\r\nIt adds an `OutputLevels` enum which can be used to define the level of the message \"log\" you are *outputting*. You can still use the old manual styles by passing `fg`, `bold`, `dim`, etc. individually to the function `black.output.out()`, but if they are specified alongside with `style=` kwarg (which specifies the `OutputLevels`) the manual styles would over-write the style specified by the `style=` kwarg. An example use case is:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nout(\r\n\terror_msg if report.return_code else \"All done! ✨ 🍰 ✨\",\r\n\tstyle=OutputLevels.success,\r\n\tbold=False,\r\n)\r\n# The final style would be {\"fg\": \"green\", \"bold\": False} \r\n# (as we are overwriting it by manually passing `bold=False`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current terminal output looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-01-20

up what I think would be okay for the level.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n- [X] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary?\r\n- [X] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n- [ ] Add new / update

Hello! Thanks for submitting a PR. To help make things go a bit more\r\n     smoothly we would appreciate that you go through this template. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n## What?\r\n\r\nI've added support for formatting Python Markdown code blocks. \r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nThese changes allow the user to format markdown files and strings. In one instance of my own (https://github.com/sunset-developer/sanic-security), I have a plethora of Python examples in my project's README.md. However, none of these examples are formatted with Black and doing so would entail me going through the pain staking process of replacing each code block example. With these changes, black can be used to automatically format all markdown code blocks instantly, and conveniently. \r\n\r\n## How?\r\n\r\nWhen Black is ran, the user would add the --docs flag in order to format any markdown files. Once ran, each code block in the Markdown is retrieved via regex and added to a list. Then, each one of these code blocks is formatted. Once each code block is formatted, the original non-formatted code block is replaced by the formatted code block and the new formatted Markdown string is returned. If no changes are made or the Markdown is empty, a `NothingChanged` error is thrown.\r\n\r\n## Testing?\r\n\r\nUnit tests have been written to make sure all desired functionality works as intended. Test data has also been created to be used as reference. \r\n\r\nFunctionality tested:\r\n\r\n* Empty Markdown raises `NothingChanged` error.\r\n* Markdown without Python code blocks raises `NothingChanges` error.\r\n* Markdown code block formatting cross-referenced with already formatted Markdown code blocks.\r\n* `--docs` flag.\r\n* Formatting Markdown strings and files.\r\n\r\nI am very open to feedback and any changes you would like me to make. Thank you for your time.\r\n\r\nIf you like these changes, I plan on adding support for .rst  and .tex files as well.\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry.

Description\r\nBug report: https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2680\r\nTest that replicates bug (see fmtskip7.py in tests/data): \r\n```py\r\na, b = 1, 2\r\nc =   6 #fmt: skip\r\nd = 5\r\n```\r\nResolve: It's seen that of all the formatting options, the inline option, or # fmt skip causes an internal error for black, when the comment should be reformatted like # fmt off. A proposal for this issue was made in the  fmtskip_nospace branch which aims to hard code logic handling this bug within the make_comment function of comments.py. \r\n\r\n\r\nNote: This does NOT handle arbitrary spacing for the # fmt: skip which should be handled in another pull request. \r\n\r\nIssues with current pull request: Building on different platforms fails due to the unit test fmtskip7.py failing when running pre-config. An investigation is further needed to resolve this issue.\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [X] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary? \r\n- [X] Add / update tests if necessary? See fmtskip7.py in tests/data\r\n- [ ] Add new / update outdated

Also, this depends a lot on the target machine (slower machines will probably have more to gain)... in my machine I'd say there's around a 50% increase in the startup speed. There's still room for improvement, but I'd say that the low-hanging fruits have been taken care of.\r\n\r\nThe number of imported modules for doing a run in this case went from `268` to `202`.\r\n\r\nIt went something as:\r\n\r\nModules imported (baseline):\r\n268\r\n\r\nWithout asyncio:\r\n235\r\n\r\nWithout concurrent.futures\r\n222\r\n\r\nWithout pathspec:\r\n214\r\n\r\nWithout multiprocessing:\r\n202\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry.

I am sorry for spamming 3 PRs. Had completed them before vacation and didn't get time to open them until now :)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWoohoo! Module specific configuration! and a bit of restructuring of code in the `black/__init__.py` file. Mainly shifting all the \"reformatting\" logic to a separate function to increase the readability of code in the click CLI  function. You can go through the code in the commit, code should be self explanatory, though I still need to update the documentation of the code and this feature.\r\n\r\nI haven't aimed at bringing new tests in this commit, if required, I could do that and this rather fixes the tests to work according to the change I have done in this commit.\r\n\r\nSummarising the changes:\r\n- Now, you can support file/module specific configuration in the pyproject.toml config under the section of `[tools.black-module]`. I have added a separate \"key\" for the modules as according to the current code when the module name could clash with a config argument. For example `[tools.black.src]` would clash with `SRC`.\r\n\r\n- Module specific configuration can only some arguments which are listed under a global constant in `config.py` and should agree with the type hint present on them in the class variables, the logic for this functionality can be seen in `cast_typehint` function of `config.py`. At some places I have ignored MYPY errors so as I couldn't change the configuration since they were being used for typing.\r\n\r\n- Added a new class for storing all the parameters, the order of the arguments is as follows:\r\n  * Read global pyproject.toml/specified config config.\r\n  * Read module specific config, which would take the none specified arguments from the global configuration.\r\n  * If value specified through click options/arguments it would be overwritten, this won't happen if the default value of the option is taken.\r\n  * Tada!\r\n\r\nCloses #1370\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n- [ ] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary?\r\n- [ ] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n- [ ] Add new / update outdated documentation?\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-07T08:31:21Z","updated_at":"2022-01-14T02:33:53Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b4dd68edd97fe633b148223a976c4328d1ae69c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ichard26","id":63936253,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTM2MjUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63936253?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26","html_url":"https://github.com/ichard26","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1348567694,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzQ4NTY3Njk0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/labels/C:%20command%20line%20/%20config","name":"C:

Description\r\n\r\nYou can now specify `config` key in pyproject.toml which does the same job as the CLI option `--config`. The path of config should be relative to the CWD it is running from. If the file is not found or is invalid i.e. it is a folder rather a TOML file it would raise `click.exceptions.FileError`, and if the file can't be parsed it would raise `tomli.TOMLDecodeError`. All black config keys in the custom config should be registered under `[black]` and they would overwrite the config specified in pyproject but not the one specified by `--config` flag while running black with the CLI.\r\n\r\nI also did a small update to `.gitignore` by grouping the \"test\" and adding `htmlcov` to it. Which is generated by `coverage html` and `.pytest_cache/` produced when you run `pytest .`.\r\n\r\nCloses #1826\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n- [x] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary?\r\n-

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently Python source files with only whitespace (space, tab, linefeed) as well as zero-length files are not reformatted but kept intact. In #2382 the consensus was that all of these should become a file with a single empty line, i.e. just a linefeed character.\r\n\r\nAlso, currently `black.format_str()` turns all-whitespace strings into zero-length strings, which is inconsistent compared to the command line and the `black.format_file_contents()` function. Wtih this patch, both functions reformat the source into a single newline.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes issue #2382.\r\n\r\n**Note:** See comments for the discussion on whether **zero-length** files should be

is the followup to #2163 as it was seen as a noticeable improvement but rejected due to the large impact on existing codebases.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, `black` will now keep user-inserted optional parentheses if at least `1` delimiter with `LOGIC_PRIORITY` or higher is present. This would allow developers the option to actively choose the improved style while not changing existing codebases.\r\n\r\n_If the idea itself is excepted, we could also discuss if this change should apply to all delimiters._\r\n\r\nExample style\r\n```py\r\n        return subscript_start is not None and any(\r\n            n.type in TEST_DESCENDANTS for n in subscript_start.pre_order()\r\n        )\r\n\r\n# OR\r\n        return (\r\n            subscript_start is not None\r\n            and any(n.type in TEST_DESCENDANTS for n in subscript_start.pre_order())\r\n        )\r\n```\r\nFor more examples, please refer to the original PR #2163 or the issue #2156 \r\n\r\nCloses: #2156\r\n\r\n/CC: @ambv, @JelleZijlstra, @cooperlees, @felix-hilden As you all have in some form participated in the original discussion, I'm especially interested in your thoughts.\r\n\r\n### Remaining tasks\r\n- [ ] Decide if the PR should move forward\r\n- [ ] _[Decide if change should apply to all delimiters]_\r\n- [ ] Fix failing tests (if any)\r\n- [ ] Add new test case\r\n- [ ] Add changelog

https://github.com/psf/black/issues/256.\r\n\r\nTODOs before this could be merged:\r\n- [ ] Get feedback/consensus on the test suite formatting matches what we desire for black to do (plus add any edge cases I didn't think of)\r\n- [ ] Similarly, confirm changes in black-primer output are reasonable (I look a look and it seemed OK to me at a glance). Am I supposed to make PRs to all the relevant upstream projects if we do want to make these formatting changes?\r\n- [ ] Get feedback on if the high-level approach makes sense (e.g. look for commas that would require a split)\r\n- [ ] Get advice on the best way to structure the code so integrates better: currently triggers flake8's \"too complex\" and needs to reuse existing tooling like BracketTracker - wasn't sure about how to do it\r\n- [ ] Add documentation that is easy to understand for black users (i.e. not just all special cases)","created_at":"2020-12-22T19:40:06Z","updated_at":"2021-11-14T03:57:28Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ac35ab72af82233538ed18a73762beea0af8a3d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2972766151,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTcyNzY2MTUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/labels/F:%20strings%20/%20docstrings","name":"F:
