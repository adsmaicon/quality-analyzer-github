added more extensions to ignore by default such as `.rar` or `.zip`, which is great. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the addition of `.tar.gz` as an extension to exclude is not working because of the implementation of the function `url_has_any_extension` which can be found in `scrapy/utils/url.py`.\r\n\r\nThe actual function looks like this:\r\n\r\n```python3\r\ndef url_has_any_extension(url, extensions):\r\n    return posixpath.splitext(parse_url(url).path)[1].lower() in extensions\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is an example that does not work:\r\n```python3\r\nimport posixpath\r\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\r\nfrom scrapy.utils.url import parse_url\r\n\r\nparsed_url = urlparse(\"https://dl.google.com/go/go1.7rc3.freebsd-amd64.tar.gz\")\r\n# ParseResult(scheme='https', netloc='dl.google.com', path='/go/go1.7rc3.freebsd-amd64.tar.gz', params='', query='', fragment='')\r\n\r\nurl_has_any_extension(parsed_url, [\".tar.gz\"])\r\n# False\r\n\r\n# Breaking down \"url_has_any_extension\" function\r\nposixpath.splitext(parse_url(parsed_url).path)[1].lower() in [\".tar.gz\"]\r\n# False\r\n\r\nposixpath.splitext(parse_url(parsed_url).path)[1].lower()\r\n# '.gz'\r\n\r\nposixpath.splitext(parse_url(parsed_url).path)\r\n# ('/go/go1.7rc3.freebsd-amd64.tar', '.gz')\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can see that the function splits the path from the first dot encountered, starting from the right, which leads to a `.tar.gz` extension not detected.\r\n\r\nI fixed the function by making use of `any` and the standard Python method

Problem description\r\nAs explained in that [issue](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/5317) files expiration does not work with GCS if you don't write at the root of your bucket. \r\nIf you want to reproduce the issue I invite you to take a look at the issue.\r\n\r\n## Issue description\r\nLet say that we set `FILES_STORE=gs://my_bucket/my_prefix/`\r\n\r\nThe issue is that for a given `path` [persist_file](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/pipelines/files.py#L234) uploads images in `gs://my_bucket/my_prefix/path` while [stats_file](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/pipelines/files.py#L217) returns information of the file located in `gs://my_bucket/path`. So there is no files that can considered as already downloaded as paths mismatch.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe solution is quite straightforward as we just need to make sure we use the same path in both `persist_file` & `stats_file`.\r\n\r\nI did not want to change `self.prefix + path` into something a bit cleaner like `os.path.join(self.prefix, path)` as it won't be backward compatible.\r\nWe could still do the same way as in S3FilesStore](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/pipelines/files.py#L122) \r\n --> `f\"{self.prefix}{path}\"`.\r\n \r\n I wrapped the logic in `_get_blob_path` to make sure we use the same logic in both places, especially if if this is  refactored in the future however it may be seen as an overkill (up to the reviewers).\r\n \r\n \r\n## Version impacted\r\nAll the versions since `GCSFilesStore` (so 1.6) seem to be impacted.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\n### Unit tests\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to find what is used in `GCS_TEST_FILE_URI` for unittest but if you set a value with a prefix like `gs://my_bucket/my_prefix` it breaks while if you set it to the root of your bucket like `gs://my_bucket/` it passes.\r\n\r\n#### On master\r\nOn my side I set `GCS_TEST_FILE_URI` to a personal bucket (with `my_prefix`) and ran the following command (after having tweaked a bit the `tox.ini` as I did not find how to run that test easily)\r\n```\r\n tox -e py -- --no-cov tests/test_pipeline_files.py::TestGCSFilesStore -v\r\n```\r\n and got the following error\r\n ```\r\n FAILED tests/test_pipeline_files.py::TestGCSFilesStore::test_persist - twisted.trial.unittest.FailTest: 'last_modified' not in {}\r\n ```\r\n \r\n #### On this branch\r\nThe test worked well\r\n```\r\ntests/test_pipeline_files.py::TestGCSFilesStore::test_persist PASSED                                                                                                                                                                                [100%]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Why not adding a new test ? \r\nAs there is already a test covering this issue I was not sure whether or not we want to add another one. If we would like to make sure that path contained in `GCS_TEST_FILE_URI` has a prefix we could still  add a one to the content of `GCS_TEST_FILE_URI`  in the test. (This is up to reviewers)
