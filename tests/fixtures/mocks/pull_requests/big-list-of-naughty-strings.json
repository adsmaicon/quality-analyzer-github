added two new sections:\r\n\r\n### JavaScript prototype pollution\r\n\r\nThis is an attack where properties are added onto Object prototype, making them part of ALL objects, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nobject.__proto__.isAdmin = true\r\n({}).isAdmin // == true\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn essence, any code containing `obj[a][b] = value` where at least `a` and `value` are user controlled are vulnerable, and many popular libraries have had this vulnerability found. More info: https://github.com/HoLyVieR/prototype-pollution-nsec18\r\n\r\nmy two naughty strings contain the standard naughty JSON with a __proto__ property, and a less likely but still possible attack where `obj[a][b][c] = value` is needed. the JSON keys are common names that are likely to break any application (items, data, attributes)\r\n\r\n### JavaScript Object properties\r\n\r\nthose are properties on the default Object prototype that will cause issues in two cases:\r\n\r\n1. Programmer writes `obj.<obj-method>()` on a user-controlled object (can crash if user supplies this method) -- the correct thing to do is `Object.prototype.<name>.call(obj, ...)`\r\n2. Programmer uses `obj[key]` on a user-controlled object to check if a key exists - this will always be truthy for Object properties, but incorrect. This logic error can be a security vulnerability in some cases.","created_at":"2020-05-26T06:53:45Z","updated_at":"2021-03-23T13:38:42Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b1d81cd0f50a70c1f303fb668a318e89c0e7dc25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings/pulls/215/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings/pulls/215/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings/issues/215/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings/statuses/8346238a82f1e3a6f62389def1e668d80e4023fb","head":{"label":"radex:javascript","ref":"javascript","sha":"8346238a82f1e3a6f62389def1e668d80e4023fb","user":{"login":"radex","id":183747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mzc0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex","html_url":"https://github.com/radex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":266963083,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjY5NjMwODM=","name":"big-list-of-naughty-strings","full_name":"radex/big-list-of-naughty-strings","private":false,"owner":{"login":"radex","id":183747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mzc0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex","html_url":"https://github.com/radex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radex/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/radex/big-list-of-naughty-strings","description":"The
