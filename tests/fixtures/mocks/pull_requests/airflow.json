When the user instantiates the `AirflowFlyteOperator`, it creates a `FlyteRemote` (Flyte's Python API) object, triggers the execution in the Flyte environment, waits for the execution to complete, and finally, returns the execution name. This implementation is carried out using the methods defined in the `hook`. The executions are triggered synchronously by default. One can set `asynchronous` to `True` if the execution needs to be polled asynchronously; the polling would be handled by the `sensor`.\r\n\r\nTests\r\n------\r\nUnit tests have been added and tested. Also, I spun up an Airflow instance to validate the code in real-time.\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n------\r\n- [ ] Update the flytekit version from `0.32.0b0` to `0.32.0` after the latter release is out.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## PR status ##\r\n\r\n**RFC** - gauging interest and feedback before continuing\r\n\r\nThis PR converts the `airflow db` CLI to using the Click and Rich frameworks with [`rich-click`](https://pypi.org/project/rich-click/) (note that I refer to the combination here as just \"Click\"). It adds a **temporary** `airflow-ng` console script entry point to enable easier/better comparisons between the existing `airflow` console script entry point and the `airflow-ng` one.\r\n\r\nWe will need to convert all the others subcommands, and I don't know of a good way to do so except converting them all at the same time.\r\n\r\n#### Reverse Compatibility ####\r\n\r\nI believe we can largely, if not entirely, keep reverse compatibility with the previous argparse-based CLI. However, if we can't completely maintain reverse compatibility, this might be a better change to implement in Airflow 3.0.\r\n\r\n## Motivation ##\r\n\r\nWhile argparse is quite extensive in what it supports, third party frameworks like Click have faster development cycles and therefore have implemented 21st century features that argparse does not, and likely will not, support. Things like a simple Python API, automatic coloring for `--help` output, use of non-symbolic ASCII characters, and a better understanding of common CLI author needs are all available with Click but aren't easily supported in argparse.\r\n\r\nWith the Rich framework, it is trivial for command authors to output text formatted with colors and other font effects.\r\n\r\nThe existing argparse implementation is a [bit of a mess with `ARG_` variables](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/c58b5e583bcad83048fdee72bc9ddf6c3a7b4229/airflow/cli/cli_parser.py#L180) for DRY, and diving into the CLI commands isn't very easy. This Click implementation also creates some examples for future conversions:\r\n\r\n* a globally reusable option (the `click_yes` decorator)\r\n* some options that are reused within a single module (`click_revision`, `click_version`, `click_from_revision`, `click_from_version`, `click_show_sql_only`)\r\n* a decorator that checks for issues with common options between the `db upgrade` and `db downgrade` subcommands\r\n\r\nAll other options are implemented as decorators for for individual functions, illustrating how to add options to subcommands in many different ways that might make sense. You can also define options that apply to command groups.\r\n\r\nSince most options are bespoke to their subcommand, it makes sense to me that they should be defined closer to where they are used instead of all in a single file. Adding options to a command via decorators makes this very easy to do.\r\n\r\n## Comparison ##\r\n\r\nWe get some things \"for free\" by converting over to Click instead of argparse.\r\n\r\n#### Formatting ####\r\n\r\n* Note the descriptions correctly rewrapping in the `airflow db upgrade --help` example as opposed to the existing argparse implementation.\r\n* The different sections of command output are rendered in their own ASCII boxes, including command errors.\r\n\r\n#### Colors! ####\r\n\r\nClick automatically colorizes output without any additional hinting.\r\n\r\n* Note how the use of colors separates pieces of information like:\r\n  - The long-form option\r\n  - The short-form option\r\n  - The type of the option value\r\n* Colors also draw your attention to the most important part of command output in a context-dependent manner\r\n  - Note how the names of the different subcommands are in bright blue, and the error output is easily recognizable in a red ASCII box.\r\n  - Some warnings (not shown) are also displayed in yellow text to differentiate them from normal output and error output, although this really depends on when the warnings are emitted at import time.\r\n\r\n### `airflow db --help` ###\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Click to expand before/after</summary>\r\n\r\n#### Before ####\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-03-29 at 9 24 38 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/597113/160751270-cc15769d-e1bf-4eca-9617-366f6579592f.png)\r\n\r\n#### After ####\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-03-29 at 9 25 47 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/597113/160751314-1f13d25e-5eeb-44ee-a9a5-d982fe07c051.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### `airflow db upgrade --help` ###\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Click to expand before/after</summary>\r\n\r\n#### Before ####\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-03-29 at 9 37 03 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/597113/160752345-1aa5c05a-0b40-4fae-a44d-5858646571ee.png)\r\n\r\n#### After ####\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-03-29 at 9 29 21 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/597113/160751665-a8b5ba05-78dd-4ebf-93a3-b5a3ff2db592.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### `airflow db upgrade --hep` (misspelled option) ###\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Click to expand before/after</summary>\r\n\r\n#### Before ####\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-03-29 at 10 05 44 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/597113/160755340-a5b00001-2a4f-4a03-b2eb-84319f408dd9.png)\r\n\r\n#### After ####\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-03-29 at 10 05 17 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/597113/160755370-dea8bf52-1b8e-4b6e-bd1a-056f0078b899.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Future Work ##\r\n\r\n#### Command Grouping ####\r\n\r\nWe can further separate the `airflow` subcommands into different groups so they are rendered into ASCII boxes with their group label (see the \"Groups and sorting\" section of the [rich-click documentation](https://pypi.org/project/rich-click/)).\r\n\r\n#### Styling Customization ####\r\n\r\nSome Airflow vendors may customize the `airflow` command. The rich-click library allows for extensive style customization.\r\n\r\n#### Click Goodies ####\r\n\r\n* The Click API makes it easier to [test the CLI](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/testing/) programmatically entirely within Python.\r\n* [Autocomplete with Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/shell-completion/) looks like it would be pretty easy to implement.\r\n* [Progress bars](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/utils/#showing-progress-bars) - imagine launching a DAG via the CLI and then viewing a progress bar while it finishes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

Overview\r\n\r\nHistorically when adding custom extra fields we had to store them in the `extra` json field as `extra__conn_type__field_name`.\r\n\r\nThis was somewhat cumbersome.  And it meant that when adding them as UI form fields, you had to make a change to the structure of the `extra` schema.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, we do away with the requirement of this prefix.  In effect, we separate the field \"key\" -- how it is identified internally in the model and form -- with \"name\", how it is identified in the `extra` json field.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with a backward compatible change, so that we can update hook classes (or class families) one at a time.\r\n\r\n### Notes on behavior\r\n\r\nFor hooks which have not updated `get_connection_form_widgets` to remove the prefixes, there's no change in behavior.\r\n\r\nBut for hooks that _have_, then in the Web UI, when reading the connection (e.g. for an update) Airflow will check first for non-prefixed value then if it doesn't find it, it will check for prefixed value.\r\n\r\nOn save, it will always store in the manner defined by `get_connection_form_widgets`.  In the case where the `extra` field was defined pre-hook-upgrade, I leave the old (prefixed) value alone, so as to be non-destructive.  However I can see an argument for removing the old vaule.\r\n\r\nWhen we update hooks to remove the prefix, we need to add a `_get_field` method to handle the extra lookup properly.  Considering what happens with new hook and old airflow, we either have to bump min airflow version, or add Airflow-backcompat logic to re-prefix when using with an old version of Airflow.  And I suppose this can be decided on a case-by-case basis with each provider.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-29T22:01:44Z","updated_at":"2022-03-30T16:26:26Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f95513666422cfa1ff9bad6c59fb1f1d12247cb5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"josh-fell","id":48934154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4OTM0MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48934154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell","html_url":"https://github.com/josh-fell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

not 100% sure we need to change the signature in this way, but please read on to see what this is about.\r\n\r\nThe base `defer` method takes params trigger, method, kwargs, and timeout, and builds a TaskDeferred exception.\r\n\r\nIn practice, building the trigger instance can be cumbersome.  And sometimes you want to reuse your deferral logic in multiple places in your operator.  In this case it's convenient to implement `defer` with different arguments and let it handle the construction of the trigger instance.  By making the `defer` signature a little more flexible, we enable subclasses to make `defer` more powerful without technically having signature inconsistencies between the base class method and the subclass implementation.\r\n\r\nSo for example, in a KPO async operator we want to defer in two places -- once, initially after we start the pod, and possibly later if we only resumed execution to get the latest logs.  \r\n\r\nSo it would be convenient in the first instance to simply call `self.defer()` and later call `self.defer(last_log_time='2021-01-01 01:02:03')`.\r\n\r\nBut currently the signature forces us to create the trigger instance in the call to `defer` which is very ugly.\r\n\r\nSee here the first call:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        self.defer(\r\n            trigger=WaitContainerTrigger(\r\n                kubernetes_conn_id=None,\r\n                hook_params={\r\n                    \"cluster_context\": self.cluster_context,\r\n                    \"config_file\": self.config_file,\r\n                    \"in_cluster\": self.in_cluster,\r\n                },\r\n                pod_name=self.pod.metadata.name,\r\n                container_name=self.BASE_CONTAINER_NAME,\r\n                pod_namespace=self.pod.metadata.namespace,\r\n                pending_phase_timeout=self.startup_timeout_seconds,\r\n                poll_interval=self.poll_interval,\r\n                logging_interval=self.logging_interval,\r\n                last_log_time=None,\r\n            ),\r\n            method_name=self.trigger_reentry.__name__,\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here the second:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        self.defer(\r\n            trigger=WaitContainerTrigger(\r\n                kubernetes_conn_id=None,\r\n                hook_params={\r\n                    \"cluster_context\": self.cluster_context,\r\n                    \"config_file\": self.config_file,\r\n                    \"in_cluster\": self.in_cluster,\r\n                },\r\n                pod_name=self.pod.metadata.name,\r\n                container_name=self.BASE_CONTAINER_NAME,\r\n

Plus each call logs too much detail to the log which fills up the volume mounted to store logs locally. This fix is one part of improving logging performance.

This is demostrated in new UT `test_find_executable_task_instances_order_priority_with_pools` - before this PR `dummy3` and `dummy1` are queued instead of `dummy3` and `dummy2`.\r\n\r\nRemoving the

PR aims to make the execution_timeout attribute to be configurable globally via airflow.cfg.\r\n\r\n* The default value is still `None`. Users are expected to\r\ndefine a positive integer value to be passed into timedelta object\r\nto set the timeout in terms of seconds by default, via configuration.\r\n* Added `gettimedelta` method in configuration to be used in abstractoperator\r\nto get timedelta or None type object. The method raises exceptions\r\nfor the values that are; \r\n  * not convertible to integer\r\n  * too large to be converted to C int.\r\n  * non-positive\r\n* Sample config cases are added into unit

include downstream tasks with `ALL_SUCCESS` `trigger_rule` to prevent tasks from being wrongly skipped by `schedule_after_task_execution`.\r\n\r\nFIXES #19222\r\n\r\nThe reported issue started after #18338: Fix mini scheduler not respecting wait_for_downstream dep\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pendulum\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.operators.python_operator import BranchPythonOperator\r\nfrom airflow.sensors.python import PythonSensor\r\nfrom airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator\r\nfrom airflow.models import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.utils.trigger_rule import TriggerRule\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"example_wrong_skip\",\r\n    schedule_interval=\"@daily\",\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n    start_date=pendulum.DateTime(2022, 1, 1),\r\n) as dag:\r\n    branch = BranchPythonOperator(task_id=\"branch\", python_callable=lambda: \"task_b\")\r\n    task_a = PythonOperator(task_id=\"task_a\", python_callable=lambda: True)\r\n    task_b = PythonOperator(task_id=\"task_b\", python_callable=lambda: True)\r\n    task_c = PythonSensor(task_id=\"task_c\", python_callable=lambda: False)\r\n    task_d = PythonOperator(task_id=\"task_d\", python_callable=lambda: True, trigger_rule=TriggerRule.NONE_FAILED_MIN_ONE_SUCCESS)\r\n\r\n    branch >> [task_a, task_b]\r\n    [task_a, task_c] >> task_d\r\n```\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-02-06 at 9 20 51 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6637585/152707755-771f3ccd-87ea-4efa-b7e6-5cf9d5b2c268.png)\r\n\r\nObserve that `task_d` which has `none_failed_min_one_success` trigger_rule is skipped before `task_c` even finishes. This violates the `trigger_rule` logic of `none_failed_min_one_success`.\r\n\r\nThis happens because #18338 changed the following line to `include_downstream=True`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            partial_dag = task.dag.partial_subset(\r\n                task.downstream_task_ids,\r\n                include_downstream=True,\r\n                include_upstream=False,\r\n                include_direct_upstream=True,\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat change caused the `partial_dag` in the \"mini scheduler\" to include all downstream tasks (even the indirect downstream tasks).\r\n\r\nIn the reproducing example, once `branch` finishes, it creates a `partial_dag` which includes `task_a`, `task_b` and `task_d` (but does not include `task_c` because it's not downstream of `branch`). Looking at only this `partial_dag`, the \"mini scheduler\" determines that `task_d` can be skipped because its only upstream task in `partial_dag` `task_a` is in skipped state. This happens in `DagRun._get_ready_tis()` when calling `st.are_dependencies_met()`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by making the \"mini scheduler\" only skip tasks that have `trigger_rule`
