change allows for controlling whether user wants to map the pre-processing function to all samples when exporting trained checkpoints to a TensorFlow 2 SavedModel. This is because this mapping, which was added in the commit https://github.com/tensorflow/models/commit/0d6ce6025ffc2bed437160fc8b2e9934b3f82fad# , results in the creation of some Tensor outputs which are not supported by certain conversion SDK and tools. So this commit presented an issue when working with exported TF2 SavedModels and their conversion to other frameworks. \r\n\r\nPlease refer to the following thread for more context:

Description\r\nThis is a fix for issue #10423, which raised `UnknownError` at `detection_model.predict(image, shapes)`.\r\nI modified the code so that the latest TensorFlow installation (which is pre-installed in Colab VMs) is used, since the  cause of the issue is TF/CUDA-cuDNN version mismatch (Colab switched to use CUDA11.2 / cuDNN 7.6.5).\r\n\r\nAnother option I thought about was to install `tensorflow==2.7.0` instead of `2.2.0`, but I discarded it because that would not prevent similar versioning issues in the future.\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\n**Test Configuration**:\r\n\r\n1. Open this notebook in Colab.\r\n2. Switch the runtime to GPU.\r\n3. (optional) Uncomment the ready-made `gt_boxes` and comment out `colab_utils.annotate()`.\r\n4. Execute all cells, and verify that `UnknownError` is not raised.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have signed the [Contributor License

tests that you ran to verify your changes.\r\n>  \r\n> * The generator can be tested using by running  `python -m official.vision.beta.projects.mesh_rcnn.data.create_pix3d_tf_record_test`\r\n\r\n**Test Configuration**:\r\nIn `create_pix3d_tf_record_test`, ensure that `pix3d_dir` is set to the directory where the raw Pix3D dataset is located. A test annotation file is provided under official/vision/beta/projects/mesh_rcnn/data called `tfrecord_pix3d_test_annotations.json`. This file should be copied into the raw dataset directory.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have signed the [Contributor License

Description\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the following [issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/10222), it was impossible to call a Bert2Bert model with the configuration option `padded_decode` set to True.\r\n\r\nIt comes from how the beam search modules deals with batch size. The special case implemented when `padded_decode` is True doesn't seem useful and caused the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Failed to convert object of type <class 'list'> to Tensor. Contents: [None, 1]. Consider casting elements to a supported type.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nI have added a naive unittest

Description\r\nHi.\r\nMade changes into `reseach/object_detection/colab_tutorials` notebooks. Everything tested in default colab environment.\r\nUPDATE: fixed broken links in object_detection repo\r\n\r\n`context_rcnn_tutorial.ipynb`: \r\n- remove unnecessary installation;\r\n- fix object_detection package installation.\r\n\r\n`convert_odt_model_to_TFLite.ipynb`, `deepmac_colab.ipynb`:\r\n- removed unused imports.\r\n\r\n`eager_few_shot_od_training_tf2_colab.ipynb`:\r\n- change the installation order (otherwise was error after object_detection package installation).\r\n- removed unused imports;\r\n- added f-strings.\r\n\r\n`generate_ssd_anchor_box_aspect_ratios_using_k_means_clustering.ipynb`:\r\n- made installation clear and the same as in other notebooks.\r\n\r\n`inference_from_saved_model_tf2_colab.ipynb`:\r\n- removed unnecessary installation (works perfectly in default colab environment);\r\n- removed unused imports;\r\n- added f-strings;\r\n- now issue #10055 can be closed.\r\n\r\n`object_detection_tutorial.ipynb`:\r\n- fix installation of object_detection package;\r\n- removed unused imports;\r\n- fixed error, that was in

Description\r\n\r\nAdd the possibility to freeze layers (via [`freeze_variables`](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/protos/train.proto#L114)) or to explicitly

training.\r\nThese parameters are defined in [`train.proto`](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/protos/train.proto).\r\n\r\nThis closes

Description\r\n\r\nwhen sub layers are created in `self.build` with subsequent `build` call, the names of the weights of sublayers get the name of the main layer which prevents keras saving in `h5`

Fix it by moving layer creation into init, then they will be built when they are called.\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n##
