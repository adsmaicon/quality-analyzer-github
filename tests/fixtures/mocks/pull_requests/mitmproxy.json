Description\r\n\r\nThis is a first PR for the implementation of the HTTP/2 keep-alive via ping as discussed in #5044 and the subsequent open issue #5046. \r\n\r\nI am open about naming of options, classes and functions, just tell me what you would like. The RequestKeepAlive command can be extended with a version int to deal with future HTTP versions that require a similar strategy but other intervals and messages.\r\n\r\nQuestions that I am not sure:\r\n - Keeping connections alive leads to more concurrently open connections. On my iPad I managed to get beyond 1200 open file handles on my Linux mitmproxy. Is that an issue?\r\n - Is there any additional safety needed in case somebody toys with layers, like accepting but ignoring events or commands in other layers?\r\n \r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n - [X] I have updated tests where applicable.\r\n - [ ] I have added an entry to the CHANGELOG.\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-18T19:55:24Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T12:15:07Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"209276b14831870878e0497c41f057a4c89ff473","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/pulls/5144/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/pulls/5144/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5144/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/statuses/8f8f9edde79ac3c8caae2ea12945bc57ec5ad5fd","head":{"label":"EndUser509:http2_keepalive","ref":"http2_keepalive","sha":"8f8f9edde79ac3c8caae2ea12945bc57ec5ad5fd","user":{"login":"EndUser509","id":42170559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTcwNTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42170559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509","html_url":"https://github.com/EndUser509","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":143845792,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDM4NDU3OTI=","name":"mitmproxy","full_name":"EndUser509/mitmproxy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"EndUser509","id":42170559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTcwNTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42170559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509","html_url":"https://github.com/EndUser509","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/EndUser509/mitmproxy","description":"An

Description\r\n\r\nAdd support for [XDG standard](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/pull/3950 seems to be in limbo, so I have implemented my own version.\r\n\r\nI'd like to draw attention to the following points:\r\n- `config.{yaml, yml}` and `keys.yaml` go under `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/mitmproxy`. However command history and anything cert-related probably count as data, not as configs, so I made them go under `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/mitmproxy`. I have also added a new option `datadir`.\r\n - xdg directories are purely opt-in: this PR does not move or remove support for `~/.mitmproxy` dir. Users can choose to move their files to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mitmproxy` and `$XDG_DATA_HOME/mitmproxy` if they like. If the user doesn't manually perform the migration, they will see no change.\r\n\r\nDifferences compared to the discussion on https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/pull/3950:\r\n- I have not exposed a `path.Pathlib` object. It's a bit more work but I don't have any problem with doing so if it's still desirable.\r\n- I have not \"killed `~/.mitmproxy` with fire\" despite it being suggested in the original discussion, as that would imply figuring out a migration path. I would recommend against breaking users setup on upgrade without warning beforehand, so this migration path would mean at least 2 releases, one with a warning that asks users to perform the migration, and the second which drops support for `~/.mitmproxy`. Then again, if the maintainers prefer migrating all users to xdg directories and would like to just migrate everyone in one go, I can change the code to do that.\r\n- >How about we add a section at the beginning of https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-options/ that looks as follows?\r\n\r\n  I have not taken this approach as the code is written in a way to make using xdg directories indefinitely purely opt-in. As such, I'd say it's reasonable to assume that people who take the manual steps to opt-in will be aware of their config situation. Please let me know if you'd prefer to add a new section at the beginning of `concepts-options.md` anyways.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n - As of this moment, the value for `confdir` is hardcoded in `app.js` and I'm wary of writing code in `web/src/js/ducks/_options_gen.ts` as it seems to be autogenerated. What would be the best course of action here if any?\r\n - I'm not sure why tests are failing on `windows-latest, 3.9`, maybe my patch isn't working on that platform? I would special-case for windows but `windows-2019, windows` tests are running so I'm not sure if that's an option. If anyone had pointers, they would be appreciated\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] I have updated tests where applicable.\r\n - [x] I have added an entry to the CHANGELOG.\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-15T03:21:07Z","updated_at":"2022-03-19T16:20:41Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f32435aaa97dcdb3bf33fc3c6ac164b0057a9e98","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/pulls/5134/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/pulls/5134/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5134/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/statuses/1dba30f3e91646f2588d5e77c409bd0ee6dedd97","head":{"label":"jrabinow:xdg_dirs_support","ref":"xdg_dirs_support","sha":"1dba30f3e91646f2588d5e77c409bd0ee6dedd97","user":{"login":"jrabinow","id":5642686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDI2ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5642686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow","html_url":"https://github.com/jrabinow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":459392637,"node_id":"R_kgDOG2HGfQ","name":"mitmproxy","full_name":"jrabinow/mitmproxy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jrabinow","id":5642686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDI2ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5642686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow","html_url":"https://github.com/jrabinow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrabinow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jrabinow/mitmproxy","description":"An

Description\r\n\r\nFixes #5001.\r\nThis PR addresses #5001 with some adjustments. We use text format provided by the protobuf library instead of JSON to present the protobuf content. The reason for that is the lack of ability to represent unknown fields with JSON.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation for modification only works on console. I've tried to make this more explicit in the name itself.\r\nIt relies on a command addon, which is not supported in web. Viewing works both in console and web.\r\n\r\nI have a couple of checks failing and I'm unable to resolve them. I would appreciate if you could give me some pointers.\r\n\r\n#### Open points\r\n - Current implementation only allows for uncompressed payload. I don't think there would be issues with adding this in the future. I've checked the existing `grpc` implementation and we could probably do something similar.\r\n - Message resolution works based on path. For example, HTTP path `example/server/GetUser` will resolve into `example.server.GetUser` and we will do an RPC lookup based on this name. I've only worked on services with this kind of mapping. I haven't managed to find any resources on whether this is a standard, so I'm a bit concerned if this method is correct. Perhaps it would make sense to introduce a way to provide custom mappings.\r\n- I have yet to verify this, but I believe that `modify_body` will not work correctly with this extension. The reason is that protobuf is a binary format. Maybe there's a way to extend this and add this support as well.\r\n- I think it would make sense to mark this addon/contenview as experimental for the time being. I also have to write some docs. What would be the right way to go about this?\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n - [X] I have updated tests where applicable.\r\n - [x] I have added an entry to the CHANGELOG.","created_at":"2022-01-25T23:34:29Z","updated_at":"2022-03-19T16:20:41Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a4a965da8c6bfd52cd7c4767fe18c0ace790081","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/pulls/5091/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/pulls/5091/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5091/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/statuses/f1e1549374b023e4108cde0390608731bc2796eb","head":{"label":"aarnaut:grpc-using-protoc","ref":"grpc-using-protoc","sha":"f1e1549374b023e4108cde0390608731bc2796eb","user":{"login":"aarnaut","id":13184484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTg0NDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13184484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut","html_url":"https://github.com/aarnaut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":438033049,"node_id":"R_kgDOGhvamQ","name":"mitmproxy","full_name":"aarnaut/mitmproxy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aarnaut","id":13184484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTg0NDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13184484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut","html_url":"https://github.com/aarnaut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarnaut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aarnaut/mitmproxy","description":"An

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently when an empty cookie attribute (`Secure`, `HttpOnly` ...) is encountered while parsing a `Set-Cookie` header it will create a `CookieAttrs` object containing a (key, value) pair with an empty string for the attribute value ie:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nCookieAttrs[('Secure', ''), ('HttpOnly', ''), ('Path', '/')]\r\n``` \r\nResulting in an updated `Set-Cookie` header for the `Response` object with invalid values for those empty attributes ie:\r\n```python\r\n(b'SetCookie', b'value=XYZ; Secure=; HttpOnly=; Path=/')\r\n``` \r\nMy browser (Firefox 95.0.1) does not pickup these attributes so the cookie looses them.\r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\nThis fix replaces the empty string attribute for empty cookie attributes by the value `None` ie:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nCookieAttrs[('Secure', None), ('HttpOnly', None), ('Path', '/')]\r\n``` \r\n\r\nSo that they can be told apart from attributes with intentional empty string values when setting the updated header, which results in a properly formatted header:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n(b'SetCookie', b'value=XYZ; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/')\r\n``` \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] I have updated tests where applicable.\r\n - [x] I have added an entry to the

Description\r\nA prototype of a quick help bar as mentioned in issue #4515.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, it looks similar to the quick help bar seen in nano. Also it is a fixed widget so it will remain at the footer for as long as the mitmproxy is open. Perhaps a future improvement would be to display it until the user presses a key? Or after a certain amount of time has passed?\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to provide feedback and thoughts, I'd be happy to hear them. :smiley: \r\n<!-- describe your changes here -->\r\n\r\n####
