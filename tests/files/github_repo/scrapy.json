extensions to ignore by default such as `.rar` or `.zip`, which is great. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the addition of `.tar.gz` as an extension to exclude is not working because of the implementation of the function `url_has_any_extension` which can be found in `scrapy/utils/url.py`.\r\n\r\nThe actual function looks like this:\r\n\r\n```python3\r\ndef url_has_any_extension(url, extensions):\r\n    return posixpath.splitext(parse_url(url).path)[1].lower() in extensions\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is an example that does not work:\r\n```python3\r\nimport posixpath\r\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\r\nfrom scrapy.utils.url import parse_url\r\n\r\nparsed_url = urlparse(\"https://dl.google.com/go/go1.7rc3.freebsd-amd64.tar.gz\")\r\n# ParseResult(scheme='https', netloc='dl.google.com', path='/go/go1.7rc3.freebsd-amd64.tar.gz', params='', query='', fragment='')\r\n\r\nurl_has_any_extension(parsed_url, [\".tar.gz\"])\r\n# False\r\n\r\n# Breaking down \"url_has_any_extension\" function\r\nposixpath.splitext(parse_url(parsed_url).path)[1].lower() in [\".tar.gz\"]\r\n# False\r\n\r\nposixpath.splitext(parse_url(parsed_url).path)[1].lower()\r\n# '.gz'\r\n\r\nposixpath.splitext(parse_url(parsed_url).path)\r\n# ('/go/go1.7rc3.freebsd-amd64.tar', '.gz')\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can see that the function splits the path from the first dot encountered,

"https://api.github.com/users/mnannan/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "## Problem description\r\nAs explained in that [issue](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/5317) files expiration does not work with GCS if you don't write at the root of your bucket. \r\nIf you want to reproduce the issue I invite you to take a look at the issue.\r\n\r\n## Issue description\r\nLet say that we set `FILES_STORE=gs://my_bucket/my_prefix/`\r\n\r\nThe issue is that for a given `path` [persist_file](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/pipelines/files.py#L234) uploads images in `gs://my_bucket/my_prefix/path` while [stats_file](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/pipelines/files.py#L217) returns information of the file located in `gs://my_bucket/path`. So there is no files that can considered as already downloaded as paths mismatch.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe solution is quite straightforward as we just need to make sure we use the same path in both `persist_file` & `stats_file`.\r\n\r\nI did not want to change `self.prefix + path` into something a bit cleaner like `os.path.join(self.prefix, path)` as it won't be backward compatible.\r\nWe could still do the same way as in S3FilesStore](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/pipelines/files.py#L122) \r\n --> `f\"{self.prefix}{path}\"`.\r\n \r\n I wrapped the logic in `_get_blob_path` to make sure we use the same logic in both places, especially if if this is  refactored in the future however it may be seen as an overkill (up to the reviewers).\r\n \r\n \r\n## Version impacted\r\nAll the versions since `GCSFilesStore` (so 1.6) seem to be impacted.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\n### Unit tests\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to find what is used in `GCS_TEST_FILE_URI` for unittest but if you set a value with a prefix like `gs://my_bucket/my_prefix` it breaks while if you set it to the root of your bucket like `gs://my_bucket/` it passes.\r\n\r\n#### On master\r\nOn my side I set `GCS_TEST_FILE_URI` to a personal bucket (with `my_prefix`) and ran the following command (after having tweaked a bit the `tox.ini` as I did not find how to run that test easily)\r\n```\r\n tox -e py -- --no-cov tests/test_pipeline_files.py::TestGCSFilesStore -v\r\n```\r\n and got the following error\r\n ```\r\n FAILED tests/test_pipeline_files.py::TestGCSFilesStore::test_persist - twisted.trial.unittest.FailTest: 'last_modified' not in {}\r\n ```\r\n \r\n #### On this branch\r\nThe test worked well\r\n```\r\ntests/test_pipeline_files.py::TestGCSFilesStore::test_persist PASSED                                                                                                                                                                                [100%]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Why not adding a new test ? \r\nAs there is already a test covering this issue I was not sure whether or not we want to add another one.

addition of `.tar.gz` as an extension to exclude is not working because of the implementation of the function `url_has_any_extension` which can be found in `scrapy/utils/url.py`.\r\n\r\nThe actual function looks like this:\r\n\r\n```python3\r\ndef url_has_any_extension(url, extensions):\r\n    return posixpath.splitext(parse_url(url).path)[1].lower() in extensions\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is an example that does not work:\r\n```python3\r\nimport posixpath\r\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\r\nfrom scrapy.utils.url import parse_url\r\n\r\nparsed_url = urlparse(\"https://dl.google.com/go/go1.7rc3.freebsd-amd64.tar.gz\")\r\n# ParseResult(scheme='https', netloc='dl.google.com', path='/go/go1.7rc3.freebsd-amd64.tar.gz', params='', query='', fragment='')\r\n\r\nurl_has_any_extension(parsed_url, [\".tar.gz\"])\r\n# False\r\n\r\n# Breaking down \"url_has_any_extension\" function\r\nposixpath.splitext(parse_url(parsed_url).path)[1].lower()

'.gz')\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can see that the function splits the path from the first dot encountered, starting from the right, which leads to a `.tar.gz` extension not detected.\r\n\r\nI fixed the

shell\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a spider with the following contents:\r\n```python\r\n# test-spiders/inspect_response_asyncio.py\r\nimport scrapy\r\n\r\nclass InspectResponseSpider(scrapy.Spider):\r\n    name = \"inspect\"\r\n    custom_settings = {\r\n        \"TWISTED_REACTOR\": \"twisted.internet.asyncioreactor.AsyncioSelectorReactor\",\r\n    }\r\n    start_urls = [\"https://example.org\"]\r\n\r\n    def parse(self, response):\r\n        scrapy.shell.inspect_response(response, self)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.

this is actually an upstream problem with `ipython` or `prompt_toolkit`.

This issue aims to centralize a set of improvements that could be addressed as part of a Google Summer of Code project.\r\n\r\n-   Implement the latest standard of cookies, the one web browsers use.\r\n\r\n    This cannot be done with the Python standard library, as its cookie implementation does not comply with the latest standards of cookies. We should look for Python libraries that do or, if none fit the bill, build our own Python library for modern cookie handling.\r\n\r\n    As part of this implementation, we should build a comprehensive set of tests covering all aspects of cookie handling. [There is a draft pull request of initial work on this front](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/5430).\r\n\r\n    Related standards:\r\n\r\n    - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265\r\n    - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis/\r\n    - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-cookie-same-site-00\r\n    - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-cookie-alone-01\r\n\r\n-   Let the `Cookie` header of a request be processed just the same as the `cookies` parameter of `Request`.\r\n\r\n    Reported at https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/1992, which we [fixed](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/2400), but we had to [revert the fix](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/4823) due to [undesired side effects](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/4717); there is however [a new draft pull request to address the issue for good](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/4812).\r\n\r\n-   Allow users to decide, for a request and its response, any combination of the following:\r\n    \r\n    -   Whether or not cookies defined by the user in the request itself (be it through the `cookies` parameter of `Request` or the `Cookie` header) should be included in the request cookiejar.\r\n    -   Whether or not cookies from the cookiejar should be included into the request.\r\n    -   Whether or not cookies received in the response should be included into the cookiejar.\r\n\r\n    Some of the combinations are already possible, e.g. by the use of the `dont_merge_cookies` and `cookiejar` request metadata keys. We should extend support to the rest of scenarios, and make sure we document all scenarios properly.\r\n\r\n    Related issues: #2124, #3769\r\n\r\n-   Provide a user-friendly API to interact with cookiejars.\r\n\r\n    Related issues: https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/1448, https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/1878, https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/2986\r\n\r\n-   Allow cookie storage\r\n\r\n    A single setting to define the storage path may be enough.\r\n\r\n    Related plugin: https://github.com/scrapedia/scrapy-cookies\r\n\r\n**Note:** A Google Summer of Code project around this idea does not need to cover everything here.

But I failed to design the flow in a good way so I'm writing this here in case somebody has ideas.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior:\r\n\r\n1. If an exception is raised when *iterating* start_requests(), if it's a generator, that exception is [logged correctly](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/3b42ccfebadd72d9b455f6526ab63835b72b1558/scrapy/core/engine.py#L155) and the spider finishes (though it finishes with the \"finished\" status and the exit code 0 which may be wrong).\r\n2. If an exception is raised when *calling* start_requests(), for scrapy crawl you get \"Unhandled error in Deferred\", the exit code 1 and no stats. #2171 is related to this but only covers `scrapy crawl`, catching the exception in the command. For e.g. CrawlerRunner the exception will cause the errback of the crawl() result to run, which depending on the user code will be either handled correctly or cause the same unhandled error exception.\r\n3. If start_requests() returns a bad result, a TypeError \"object is not iterable\" will be raised with the same behavior as in the previous case.\r\n\r\nI would like all these cases to be handled better, with proper \"Error calling start_requests()\" and \"start_requests() returned an object of a wrong type\" log messages, but I'm not sure what behavior do we want. Initially I saw it as \"if an exception happened here, we cannot continue so print a good message and return\" but this is hard to implement considering the \"catch-shutdown the engine-reraise\" flow in crawl() and also may be not the best way to handle this in the context of CrawlerRunner. Or we could always raise some exception with a good message and add catching it in the crawl and runspider commands.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/5426/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/5426/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/5424", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/5424/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/5424/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/5424/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/5424", "id": 1145631777, "node_id": "I_kwDOAAgUXs5ESPQh", "number": 5424, "title": "scrapy parse doesn't support async callbacks", "user": {"login": "wRAR", "id": 241039, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTAzOQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/241039?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wRAR", "html_url": "https://github.com/wRAR", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wRAR/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wRAR/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wRAR/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wRAR/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wRAR/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wRAR/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wRAR/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wRAR/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wRAR/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 13907246, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMzkwNzI0Ng==", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "fc2929", "default": true, "description": null}, {"id": 3270783977, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwzMjcwNzgzOTc3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/labels/asyncio", "name": "asyncio", "color": "fef2c0", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-02-21T10:50:47Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-21T10:51:06Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "In master when running `scrapy parse` for a spider with `async def parse` the page is downloaded but then the spider hangs.
