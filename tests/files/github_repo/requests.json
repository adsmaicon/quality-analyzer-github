formatting to Requests. Now that we intend to drop Python 2 support, we have the opportunity to clean up multiple conflicting code styles that have crept into Requests over the years.\r\n\r\nThis PR will introduce a few standard changes:\r\n\r\n* Integration of `black` for code formatting, bringing Requests in-line with what has largely become the standard.\r\n* Integration of `isort` to ensure our imports are automatically grouped and cleaned.\r\n* Integration of `pyupgrade` which will automatically pull most of the code base to Python 3.7 syntax.\r\n* Addition of a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to orchestrate the above tools.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n- [x] Rebase on to #6091 before merge\r\n- [ ] Resolve formatting issues with server response line wrapping in `tests/test_lowlevel.py`\r\n- [ ] Add .git-blame-ignore-revs file\r\n- [x] Fix inconsistent f-string upgrades\r\n- [ ] Enable and fix flake8 issues", "created_at": "2022-03-23T20:15:49Z", "updated_at": "2022-03-28T18:50:09Z", "closed_at":

"body": "Sending of chunked-encoded data is not currently tested to be correct anywhere in requests' tests, and is called out as a needed improvement in #5906.  This is a hurdle to accepting #5664, a change which would both simplify requests' code and consistently use [urllib3 for retrying errors](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/urllib3.util.html).  \r\n\r\nThe [existing test server](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/tests/testserver/server.py) is a simple socket that can send and receive data and is not aware of HTTP protocols.  Therefore, using it to verify correct sending of chunked-encoded data, for instance, would ultimately become a change-detector test.  \r\n\r\nThis change seeks to remedy that while also taking a step towards both simplifying and strengthening requests' tests.\r\n\r\nWe strengthen requests' tests by introducing the popular [Werkzeug library](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug) as an explicit test dependency ([Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask), which uses Werkzeug, is already a test dependency).  By doing so, we leverage their authority as an implementer of [PEP 3333](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/) to validate our own implementation of chunked encoding.  This implicitly future-proofs against any hypothetical breaking changes to the standard by testing against Werkzeug's trusted implementation.\r\n\r\nWe also simplify requests' tests, since the implementation of the test [WerkzeugServer](https://github.com/psf/requests/commit/f1f838e36bc24fb40d7121e72298da3e5a7149ff#diff-a53b39ec2e425dad0c8387f8402839b2ec328e93494086ed66abb4b49708deeb) here is substantially more concise than the [current test server](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/tests/testserver/server.py).  If this change is accepted, in another pull request I will refactor all of requests' tests to use the WerkzeugServer rather than the current test server.

Instead, the DNS resolution happens at the level of the client, causing a DNS leak.\r\n\r\nThis happens with various versions/combinations of Requests/PySocks/Python, the latter being the Apple Silicon versions obtained through pyenv. I have tested this using the local SOCKS5 proxy server provided by Tor.\r\n\r\nIn more detail, I tested the bug on various pyenv Python distributions, labeled 3.8 to 3.10 plus miniforge3, with Requests from v2.16.0 to v2.27.1, and PySocks from v1.5.7 to v1.7.1 (not every single version in between). In what follows, I'll use an example System Information output.\r\n\r\nAlso, I used Wireshark to monitor the DNS requests, and I used curl with the --proxy socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050 flag as a control, to make sure that the local Tor proxy was working properly and that the DNS leak is indeed specific to Python/Requests/PySocks.\r\n\r\nI am not able to confirm whether the DNS leak also happens on Python versions obtained other than through pyenv. On an Intel MacBook using an Anaconda Python version and the latest Requests/PySocks, the leak does not occur.\r\n\r\n## Expected Result\r\n\r\nWhen using the \"socks5h\" scheme, the DNS requests should be forwarded to the SOCKS proxy.\r\n\r\n## Actual Result\r\n\r\nThe DNS requests are sent from the client instead, causing a DNS leak.\r\n\r\n## Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nInstall any Apple Silicon Python version from pyenv (see above for the versions I tested) and start Tor.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport requests\r\n\r\nproxies = {\r\n    \"http\": \"socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050\",\r\n    \"https\": \"socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050\",\r\n}\r\n\r\nresp = requests.get(\"https://\"+url, proxies=proxies)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMonitor the outgoing DNS requests using Wireshark. If they are sent via the outbound network interface to your pre-configured DNS server (as opposed to the local interface, destination IP 127.0.0.1, port 9050), a DNS leak is occurring.\r\n\r\n## System Information\r\n\r\n    $ python -m requests.help\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"chardet\": {\r\n    \"version\": null\r\n  },\r\n  \"charset_normalizer\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"2.0.12\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"cryptography\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"idna\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"3.3\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"implementation\": {\r\n    \"name\": \"CPython\",\r\n    \"version\": \"3.10.2\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"platform\": {\r\n    \"release\": \"21.4.0\",\r\n    \"system\": \"Darwin\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"pyOpenSSL\": {\r\n    \"openssl_version\": \"\",\r\n    \"version\": null\r\n  },\r\n  \"requests\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"2.27.1\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"system_ssl\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"101010df\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"urllib3\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"1.26.8\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"using_charset_normalizer\": true,\r\n  \"using_pyopenssl\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- This command is only available on Requests v2.16.4 and greater.

"# Overview\r\n\r\nAs we enter our third year of Python 2.7 reaching end-of-life, Requests has decided it's time to start deprecating our support. While we have yet to confirm a date, we want to provide early notice that this is coming at some point in 2022. This follows as the majority of our critical downstream consumers have finished their deprecation campaigns. While we understand this may be viewed as an inconvenience for those still using Python 2.7, I'll try to layout the steps we're taking to ensure a smooth transition.\r\n\r\nIn January, we will be releasing Requests 2.27.0. This is intended to be the last minor release with guaranteed support, including all 2.27.x hotfix releases. We've taken steps to ensure this release series includes fixes for some of the longer standing pain points and provide as much long term stability as we're able. Users who intend to continue Python 2.7 use should review the `Mitigation Steps` section of this issue.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, we're still working through what a Python 3-only Requests looks like. We'd like to preface now that it's unlikely to contain many of the more exciting features that may have previously been promised by former maintainers. In future releases, we'll look to add quality-of-life improvements as they make sense while maintaining the primary focus of stability in the library. We'll provide more on that as information is available.\r\n\r\n# Mitigation Steps\r\n\r\nFor Requests users that intend to remain on Python 2.7 through 2022, we recommend taking the following mitigation steps.\r\n\r\n1. For users of `pip` 9.0+, we'll also be releasing an update to the `python_requires` metadata to `>=3.7` in Requests. This will prevent unintended installation on unsupported Python versions.\r\n2. For users who want to codify this requirement across all environments, ensure that you've explicitly pinned Requests in your workspace or project to `requests<2.28`. This will prevent unintended interruptions with future releases.\r\n3. For users of LTS operating systems providing Python 2.7 support through 2023, you'll need to work with their support teams for  bug or security issues for any releases after 2.27.", "reactions":

However this format is set as `'%a, %d-%b-%Y %H:%M:%S GMT'` which is none of allowed expires section date value described in RFC (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6265#section-4.1.1).\r\n\r\nThe nearest format is the first choice from https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#section-3.3.1.

The `async_asgi_testclient` collects cookies using `SimpleCookie` class from standard `http` lib and then pass them to `requests` lib which is used to perform client test requests.\r\n\r\nBut this issue is not related to these packages as I reproduced it using only Python standard `http` lib and `requests` as above.\r\n\r\n## System Information\r\n\r\n    $ python -m requests.help\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"chardet\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"4.0.0\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"charset_normalizer\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"2.0.9\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"cryptography\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"idna\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"3.3\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"implementation\": {\r\n    \"name\": \"CPython\",\r\n    \"version\": \"3.9.9\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"platform\": {\r\n    \"release\": \"5.15.0-1-amd64\",\r\n    \"system\": \"Linux\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"pyOpenSSL\": {\r\n    \"openssl_version\": \"\",\r\n    \"version\": null\r\n  },\r\n  \"requests\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"2.26.0\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"system_ssl\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"101010cf\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"urllib3\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"1.26.7\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"using_charset_normalizer\": false,\r\n  \"using_pyopenssl\": false\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests/issues/6004/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests/issues/6004/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests/issues/5975", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests/issues/5975/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests/issues/5975/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests/issues/5975/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/5975", "id": 1052405538, "node_id": "I_kwDOABTKOs4-um8i", "number": 5975, "title": "How to regenerate Authorization header for each retry?", "user": {"login": "vitaly-krugl", "id": 1441066, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDEwNjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1441066?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitaly-krugl", "html_url": "https://github.com/vitaly-krugl", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitaly-krugl/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitaly-krugl/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitaly-krugl/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitaly-krugl/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitaly-krugl/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitaly-krugl/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitaly-krugl/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitaly-krugl/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitaly-krugl/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 8, "created_at": "2021-11-12T21:02:34Z", "updated_at": "2021-12-05T17:48:56Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "I am using requests 2.23.0 with Python 3.8. \r\n\r\nMy app configures the `requests.packages.urllib3.util.retry.Retry` instance and then passes it via the `max_retries` arg to `requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter` constructor and then mounts the adapter as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass RetriableSslSession(requests.Session):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        super(RetriableSslSession, self).__init__()\r\n\r\n        self.mount('https://', create_default_ssl_adapter())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen before making a request, my app sets `session.auth` to an instance of [EdgeGridAuth](https://github.com/akamai/AkamaiOPEN-edgegrid-python/blob/master/akamai/edgegrid/edgegrid.py) that is derived from `requests.auth.AuthBase`.\r\n\r\nSince EdgeGridAuth implements the [AuthBase.\\_\\_call\\_\\_](https://github.com/akamai/AkamaiOPEN-edgegrid-python/blob/bbfd58b75a61684ef72e29d2dab2e81492b3f4cb/akamai/edgegrid/edgegrid.py#L257) method, I expected that the Authorization header would be generated for each retry.

"Sending of chunked-encoded data is not currently tested to be correct anywhere in requests' tests, and is called out as a needed improvement in #5906.  This is a hurdle to accepting #5664, a change which would both simplify requests' code and consistently use [urllib3 for retrying errors](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/urllib3.util.html).  \r\n\r\nThe [existing test server](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/tests/testserver/server.py) is a simple socket that can send and receive data and is not aware of HTTP protocols.  Therefore, using it to verify correct sending of chunked-encoded data, for instance, would ultimately become a change-detector test.  \r\n\r\nThis change seeks to remedy that while also taking a step towards both simplifying and strengthening requests' tests.\r\n\r\nWe strengthen requests' tests by introducing the popular [Werkzeug library](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug) as an explicit test dependency ([Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask), which uses Werkzeug, is already a test dependency).  By doing so, we leverage their authority as an implementer of [PEP 3333](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/) to validate our own implementation of chunked encoding.  This implicitly future-proofs against any hypothetical breaking changes to the standard by testing against Werkzeug's trusted implementation.\r\n\r\nWe also simplify requests' tests, since the implementation of the test [WerkzeugServer](https://github.com/psf/requests/commit/f1f838e36bc24fb40d7121e72298da3e5a7149ff#diff-a53b39ec2e425dad0c8387f8402839b2ec328e93494086ed66abb4b49708deeb) here is substantially more concise than the [current test server](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/tests/testserver/server.py).  If this change is accepted, in another pull request I will refactor all of requests' tests to use the WerkzeugServer rather than the current test server.

strange for something as central in the Python ecosystem as `requests` is (45k stars, 8k forks, many contributors at the time of writing)  to switch to such a relatively unknown and unproven library (132 stars, 5 forks, 2 contributors) for a _hard_ dependency in something as central in the Python ecosystem as `requests` is. \r\n\r\nThe release notes say you could use `pip install \"requests[use_chardet_on_py3]\"` to use `chardet` instead of `charset_normalizer`, but with that extra set both libraries get installed.\r\n\r\nI would imagine many users don't really necessarily need the charset detection features in Requests; could we open a discussion on making both `chardet`/`charset_normalizer` optional, \u00e1 la `requests[chardet]` or `requests[charset_normalizer]`?\r\n\r\nAFAICS, the only place where `chardet` is actually used in `requests` is `Response.apparent_encoding`, which is used by `Response.text` when there is no

defined in an ``OrderedDict``, their order might change if they coincide with the ``default_headers`` set in ``utils.py``, namely ``User-Agent``, ``Accept-Encoding``, ``Accept``, and ``Connection``.\r\n\r\n## Expected Result\r\nThe order of the headers should not change when passed as an ``OrderedDict``. So for example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport requests\r\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\r\n\r\nheaders = OrderedDict([\r\n    (\"Accept\",   '1'),\r\n    (\"Accept-Encoding\",   '2'),\r\n    (\"User-Agent\",   '3'),\r\n])\r\nr = requests.get('http://www.example.com', headers=headers)\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould result in the ``Accept`` header coming first, followed by ``Accept-Encoding`` and finally ``User-Agent``.\r\n\r\n## Actual Result\r\nThe ``User-Agent`` comes first, followed by ``Accept-Encoding`` and then ``Accept`` \r\n\r\n## Reason\r\nThe default headers --- as set by ``requests.utils.default_headers()`` --- are merged with the user specified headers by the function ``requests.sessions.merge_settings``. This function first takes the default headers and then updates that with the user specified headers. This ensures that user specified headers overwrite the default ones.\r\n\r\nHowever, the update process does not change the order of the default headers. So when setting ``User-Agent`` after ``Accept``, this will not be taken into account as both headers are already in the default headers and in reverse order.\r\n\r\nA fix to ``merge_settings`` could be to take the user specified headers first, and then iterate over the default headers and add them in if their are misssing.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\nIf one wants exactly the headers specified, one can first create a ``Session`` and remove the default headers:\r\n\r\n```\r\ns = requests.Session()\r\ns.headers = {}\r\nr = s.get(url, headers=headers, ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaving a way to change the default headers on the ``requests`` module would be a welcome addition. So one could change, for example, the user agent in one place and have it affect all requests calls that follow.\r\n\r\n## Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport requests\r\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\r\n\r\nheaders = OrderedDict([\r\n    (\"Accept\",   '1'),\r\n    (\"Accept-Encoding\",   '2'),\r\n    (\"User-Agent\",   '3'),\r\n])\r\nr = requests.get('http://www.example.com', headers=headers)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## System Information\r\n\r\n    $ python -m requests.help\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"chardet\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"4.0.0\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"cryptography\": {\r\n

trying to narrow this report down to a very specific scope: **connection** timeout is behaving in a consistent, wrong way: it times out at _precisely_ **twice** the requested time.\r\n\r\nResults below are _so_ consistent we must acknowledge there is _something_ going on here! I **beg** you guys not to dismiss this report before taking a look at it!\r\n\r\nWhat this report is **not** about:\r\n- Total/Wall timeout:\r\nThat would be a nice feature, but I'm fully aware this is currently outside the scope of Requests. I'm focusing on _connection_ timeout only.\r\n\r\n- Read timeout:\r\nAll my tests were using http://google.com:81, which fails to even _connect_. There's no read involved, the server exists but never responds, not even to refuse the connection. No data is ever transmitted. No HTTP connection is ever established. This is **not** about `ReadTimeoutError`, this is about `ConnectTimeoutError`.\r\n\r\n- Accurate timings / network fluctuations:\r\nNot asking for millisecond precision. I don't even care about _whole seconds_ imprecision. But, surprisingly, `requests` is being incredibly accurate... to _twice_ the time.\r\n\r\n## Expected Result\r\n\r\n`requests.get('http://google.com:81', timeout=(4, 1))` should take _approximately_ 4 seconds to timeout.\r\n\r\n## Actual Result\r\n\r\nIt _consistently_ takes about 8.0 seconds to raise `requests.ConnectTimeout`. It always takes twice the time, for timeouts ranging from 1 to 100. Exception message clearly says in the end: `Connection to google.com timed out. (connect timeout=4)`, a very distinct message from read timeouts.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport requests, time, os, sys\r\n\r\n# Using a know URL to test connection timeout\r\ndef test_timeout(timeout, url='http://google.com:81'):\r\n    start = time.time()\r\n    try:\r\n        requests.get(url, timeout=timeout)\r\n        print(\"OK!\")  # will never reach this...\r\n    except requests.ConnectTimeout:  # any other exception will bubble out\r\n        print('{}: {:.1f}'.format(timeout, time.time()-start))\r\n\r\nprint(\"\\n1 to 10, simple numeric timeout\")\r\nfor i in range(1, 11):\r\n    test_timeout(i)\r\n\r\nprint(\"\\n1 to 10, (x, 1) timeout tuple\")\r\nfor i in range(1, 11):\r\n    test_timeout((i, 1))\r\n\r\nprint(\"\\n1 to 10, (x, 10) timeout tuple\")\r\nfor i in range(1, 11):\r\n    test_timeout((i, 1))\r\n\r\nprint(\"\\nLarge timeouts\")\r\nfor i in (20, 30, 50, 100):\r\n    test_timeout((i, 1))\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n```\r\nLinux desktop 5.4.0-66-generic #74~18.04.2-Ubuntu SMP Fri Feb 5 11:17:31 UTC 2021 x86_64\r\n3.6.9 (default, Jan 26 2021, 15:33:00) \r\n[GCC 8.4.0]\r\nRequests: 2.25.1\r\nUrllib3: 1.26.3\r\n\r\n1 to 10, simple numeric timeout\r\n1: 2.0\r\n2: 4.0\r\n3: 6.0\r\n4: 8.0\r\n5: 10.0\r\n6: 12.0\r\n7: 14.0\r\n8: 16.0\r\n9: 18.0\r\n10: 20.0\r\n\r\n1 to 10, (x, 1) timeout tuple\r\n(1, 1): 2.0\r\n(2, 1): 4.0\r\n(3, 1): 6.0\r\n(4, 1): 8.0\r\n(5, 1): 10.0\r\n(6, 1): 12.0\r\n(7, 1): 14.0\r\n(8, 1): 16.0\r\n(9, 1): 18.0\r\n(10, 1): 20.0\r\n\r\n1 to 10, (x, 10) timeout tuple\r\n(1, 10): 2.0\r\n(2, 10): 4.0\r\n(3, 10): 6.0\r\n(4, 10): 8.0\r\n(5, 10): 10.0\r\n(6, 10): 12.0\r\n(7, 10): 14.0\r\n(8, 10): 16.0\r\n(9, 10): 18.0\r\n(10, 10): 20.0\r\n\r\nLarge timeouts\r\n(20, 1): 40.0\r\n(30, 1): 60.0\r\n(50, 1): 100.1\r\n(100, 1): 200.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n## System Information\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"chardet\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"3.0.4\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"cryptography\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"3.2.1\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"idna\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"2.8\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"implementation\": {\r\n    \"name\": \"CPython\",\r\n    \"version\": \"3.6.9\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"platform\": {\r\n    \"release\": \"5.4.0-66-generic\",\r\n    \"system\": \"Linux\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"pyOpenSSL\": {\r\n    \"openssl_version\": \"1010108f\",\r\n    \"version\": \"17.5.0\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"requests\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"2.25.1\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"system_ssl\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"1010100f\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"urllib3\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"1.26.3\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"using_pyopenssl\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems there **is** a single, \"hidden\", connection retry, performed by either `requests` or `urllib3`, somewhere in the line.
