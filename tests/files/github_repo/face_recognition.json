changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>21.1 (2021-04-24)</h1>\n<h2>Process</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Start installation scheme migration from <code>distutils</code> to <code>sysconfig</code>. A\nwarning is implemented to detect differences between the two implementations to\nencourage user reports, so we can avoid breakages before they happen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add the ability for the new resolver to process URL constraints. (<code>[#8253](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8253) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8253&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Add a feature <code>--use-feature=in-tree-build</code> to build local projects in-place\nwhen installing. This is expected to become the default behavior in pip 21.3;\nsee <code>Installing from local packages &lt;https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#installing-from-local-packages&gt;</code>_\nfor more information. (<code>[#9091](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9091) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9091&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Bring back the &quot;(from versions: ...)&quot; message, that was shown on resolution failures. (<code>[#9139](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9139) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9139&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Add support for editable installs for project with only setup.cfg files. (<code>[#9547](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9547) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9547&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Improve performance when picking the best file from indexes during <code>pip install</code>. (<code>[#9748](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9748) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9748&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Warn instead of erroring out when doing a PEP 517 build in presence of\n<code>--build-option</code>. Warn when doing a PEP 517 build in presence of\n<code>--global-option</code>. (<code>[#9774](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9774) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9774&gt;</code>_)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed <code>--target</code> to work with <code>--editable</code> installs. (<code>[#4390](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4390) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4390&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Add a warning, discouraging the usage of pip as root, outside a virtual environment. (<code>[#6409](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6409) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6409&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Ignore <code>.dist-info</code> directories if the stem is not a valid Python distribution\nname, so they don't show up in e.g. <code>pip freeze</code>. (<code>[#7269](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7269) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7269&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Only query the keyring for URLs that actually trigger error 401.\nThis prevents an unnecessary keyring unlock prompt on every pip install\ninvocation (even with default index URL which is not password protected). (<code>[#8090](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8090) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8090&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Prevent packages already-installed alongside with pip to be injected into an\nisolated build environment during build-time dependency population.

reading a base64 image. Primary motivation for creation of this feature is with the extensive online work being done, it is easier to have an all-in-one solution than to have a user import another library and have additional code unrelated to the user's use case.  \r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Support to load base 64 images\r\n- Support to directly load online images\r\n\r\n## Code Examples\r\n### Online Images\r\n```\r\nimport face-recognition\r\nimage = load_image_online(r'https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/tests/test_images/obama.jpg?raw=true')\r\nface_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Base64 Image\r\n```\r\nimport face-recognition\r\nimage = load_image_file(base64_string, base64_image=True)\r\nface_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n- [X] docstring in function\r\n- [X] flake8 formatting check\r\n- [X] Added Tests for features\r\n- [x] Github Actions all tests

I have attempted multiple installation combinations of Dlib and the Face Recognition library, but none have succeeded in enabling me to use the \"cnn\" model with the face_locations() function (each failing with different kinds of errors).\r\n\r\nNote: In each of the below cases, any problem was exhibited regardless of the image loaded into the face_locations() function. Where Dlib was built from source, the Dlib compilation process always reported that \"DLIB WILL USE CUDA\". Installations of Dlib that could be successfully imported into Python always returned True and 1 when \"dlib.DLIB_USE_CUDA\" and \"print(dlib.cuda.get_num_devices())\" were entered into Python respectively.\r\n\r\n### Installation Process\r\n\r\nOriginally, I attempted to install Dlib version 19.22.1 via \"pip3 install dlib\" (the latest version at the time prior to the release of Dlib version 19.23). I didn't think that I needed to implement the fix in Dlib for Jetson Nano outlined in the \"Jetson Nano installation instructions\" article in the README, as the problem mentioned in the article had supposedly since been fixed in a past cuDNN/JetPack SDK update. The library downloaded successfully, but attempting to import the library was met with \"Segmentation fault (core dumped)\". Research suggested that I try downgrading the library to version 19.21.1 and, on doing so (using pip), was able to import the library without issue and use it with face_recognition.\r\n\r\nI then tried to use the \"cnn\" model with the face_locations() function in a simple program to detect the position of a face in an image. Each time I ran the program, the GPU showed 0% usage, and it would either freeze the computer before failing with \"Killed\" in the terminal (usually after a few minutes), or completely freeze up the entire system, forcing me to perform a hard restart of the computer. Using other face_recognition functions, such as face_encodings() and compare_faces() (for facial recognition), or face_locations() with the default HOG-based model worked without error.\r\n\r\nWith the release of Dlib 19.23, I uninstalled Dlib 19.21.1 and tried installing Dlib 19.23 using pip, but was also met with \"Segmentation fault (core dumped)\" on import into Python, as with Dlib 19.22.1. To rule out not building Dlib from source as being an issue, I uninstalled 19.23 and built from source the previously working Dlib 19.21 release (without applying the old cuDNN \"forward_algo = forward_best_algo\" fix), but the \"cnn\" model still failed to run.\r\n\r\nI then attempted to build 19.23 using NumPy 1.19.4 (instead of version 1.19.5 that was previously installed on my system and used for the above few Dlib installations) and exporting the \"OPENBLAS_CORETYPE=ARMV8\" environmental variable into the Terminal (suggestions from the internet to fix the \"Segmentation fault\" on import issue), with no success.\r\n\r\nMy current installation now consists of a built from source version of Dlib 19.21 (using NumPy 1.19.4), following the instructions to comment out \"forward_algo = forward_best_algo\" before compiling the package. On running the \"cnn\" model with face_locations(), the GPU, for the first time, showed GPU usage (99%), before the program crashed 15-20 seconds later with the following error:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\nClick the arrow to view the full Python Terminal crash output.\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"face-recog-test.py\", line 36, in <module>\r\n    face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image, number_of_times_to_upsample=0, model=\"cnn\")\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/face_recognition/api.py\", line 119, in face_locations\r\n    return [_trim_css_to_bounds(_rect_to_css(face.rect), img.shape) for face in _raw_face_locations(img, number_of_times_to_upsample, \"cnn\")]\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/face_recognition/api.py\", line 103, in _raw_face_locations\r\n    return cnn_face_detector(img, number_of_times_to_upsample)\r\nRuntimeError: Error while calling cudnnFindConvolutionBackwardDataAlgorithm( context(), (const cudnnFilterDescriptor_t)filter_handle, descriptor(dest_desc), (const cudnnConvolutionDescriptor_t)conv_handle, descriptor(data), num_possilbe_algorithms, &num_algorithms, perf_results.data()) in file /home/dev/dlib-19.21/dlib/cuda/cudnn_dlibapi.cpp:856. code: 4, reason: A call to cuDNN failed\r\ncudaStreamDestroy() failed.

my Nano as much as OOB as possible\r\nIts just been re-created using jetpack 4.6 \r\n\r\nI have been adapting one of the JetsonHacks ideas to my own code involving facial recognition from video with Face_recognition.\r\nI applied the one line code fix to dlib as outlined in \r\nhttps://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/issues-with-dlib-library/72600/16\r\nhttps://medium.com/@ageitgey/build-a-hardware-based-face-recognition-system-for-150-with-the-nvidia-jetson-nano-and-python-a25cb8c891fd\r\nthese relate to dlib 19.16 and 19.17 but it seems to still apply to 19.22\r\nThat got face_recognition to use the GPU when model=\"cnn\" was used\r\n\r\nHowever I am finding the startup time to be horrible\r\nthe first call to face_recognition.face_locations(imageRGB  ,model=\"cnn\" )  takes 22 to 25 seconds.\r\nsubsequent calls take about 0.3 sec to 0.9 sec for larger images\r\nfor the 1st call it doesn't matter what size the image is\r\n\r\nIf the model is changed to model=\"hog\"  then the first call to face_recognition.face_locations, and each subsequent takes about 0.6 sec\r\n\r\nSimilar results for the calls to face_recognition.face_encodings \r\nModel='cnn' initial 2.69 sec then .04sec  again size doesn't seem to affect it too much\r\nModel='hog' initial from 5.5 to 10 sec then .04sec  \r\n\r\nOver 20 seconds just feels like a timeout issue, probably between face_recognition and dlib, but that just me using 'the force' \r\n\r\nDoes anybody have any ideas how to make all these bits play nicely together?\r\n\r\n```\r\nPython 3.6.9\r\ndlib.DLIB_USE_CUDA = True\r\ndlib version = 19.22.0\r\ndlib compiled = Nov 14 2021 16:36:45\r\nface_recognition.__version__ =
