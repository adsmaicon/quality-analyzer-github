uncompressed file size greater than 256mb is used as the code source.\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\nThis behavior can be reproduced using [this test](https://github.com/RodrigoATorres/localstack/blob/feature/lambda_unzip_max_size/tests/integration/awslambda/test_lambda_size_lims.py). When running against localstack, the test with the over-sized zip file does not pass. But it passes when running with TEST_TARGET=\"AWS_CLOUD\".\r\n\r\nWhat this test does is generate a python file with a size greater than the limit, compress it, save to s3, and try to create a lambda function using it. The lambda api should not allow the function to be created.\r\n\r\n# Fix\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, a check on the unzipped code size was added to the \"do_set_function_code\" function. If size is greater than the limit, a exception is raised\r\n", "created_at": "2022-03-09T18:16:25Z", "updated_at": "2022-03-31T18:30:27Z", "closed_at": null, "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha":

WIP\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a HTTP request handling framework based on the concept of request Handlers and Handler Chains, essentially replacing the edge proxy.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n- [ ] Implement new HTTP request handling (while not breaking the previous functionality).\r\n- [ ] Migrate current features of the edge proxy (service detection,...) into separate handlers.\r\n- [ ] Fix all integration tests with the new request handling enabled.\r\n- [ ] Hide the new functionality behind a feature flag (opt-in).", "created_at": "2022-01-08T19:48:02Z", "updated_at":

suitable timeouts selected based on empirical data\n  * workarounds for all the stream reads put in place\n\nAlso added additional helpful logging/output which will assist Windows users in troubleshooting.\n\nTested on Windows 10 using the Linux Subsystem for Windows.

issues\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\n**AWS NeptuneDB**: When a new vertex is added into graph in AWS Neptune DB, it creates new UUID as default and assigns to vertex as T.id. \r\n**localstack NeptuneDB**: When a new vertex is added into graph in localstack pro NeptuneDB, it creates new integer id and assigns to vertex as T.id.\r\n\r\nSo it appears that the DefaultIdManager in localstack is generating integer ids, whereas AWS Neptune is generating string UUIDs.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n**Desired**: default ID generation behavior should be same which means in localstack it should generate default string UUID instead of integer id \r\n\r\n**Optional**: provide a mechanism to configure/override default behavior in localstack configuration.\r\n\r\n### How are you starting LocalStack?\r\n\r\nWith a docker-compose file\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n#### How are you starting localstack (e.g., `bin/localstack` command, arguments, or `docker-compose.yml`)\r\n\r\n    `docker-compose up`\r\n\r\n#### After starting localstack, create new DB cluster using following command\r\n\r\n    `awslocal neptune create-db-cluster --engine \"neptune\" --db-cluster-identifier \"neptunelocaldb\"`\r\n\r\n#### Now using any client follow these steps - (we used Jypyter notebook as well as C# Gremlin.Net)\r\nCreate new vertex and then query using the default id\r\n\r\n#### With AWS Neptune\r\ng.addV(\"person\")\r\n\r\n//Returns New vertex created\r\nv[4abff024-cc4e-c05c-f269-8c5e4b5d00e8]\r\n\r\n//Now query the vertex using id\r\ng.V(\"4abff024-cc4e-c05c-f269-8c5e4b5d00e8\")\r\n\r\n//above query returns the newly created vertex\r\n\r\n\r\n#### With Localstack Neptune\r\ng.addV(\"person\")\r\n\r\n// Returns New vertext created\r\nv[41]\r\n\r\n// Now query the vertex using the ID\r\ng.V(41) or g.V(\"41\")\r\n\r\n// both queries above return empty list (no vertex found)\r\n\r\n\r\n###

For authentication, this API uses JWT tokens, passed through the \"authorization\" HTTP header, with value \"Bearer <the JWT token>\". Authentication is optional, so requests may or may not include said header\r\n\r\nOn the app running on AWS, the \"authorization\" header received by my app matches exactly what is sent in the request to the public URL (that is proxied through API Gateway) - specifically, if no header is sent by the end user, no header is present on the request received by my app. \r\n\r\nHowever, on localstack, if I issue a GET request, with no \"authorization\" header, my application get a \"authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 <...>\". For context/more info, if my request to localstack has a \"authorization\" header, is seems to be passed as-is.\r\n\r\nSo it seems that, if no \"authorization\" header is present, localstack injects one, which differs from the behavior on AWS. I am using terraform to configure both, with the config for localstack piggybacking off the one I am using for AWS, so I am pretty confident the difference does not lie there. \r\n\r\nBefore I spend a few hours trying to set up a PoC repo that illustrates this issue, I wanted to ask if this is known/intentional.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your time, and sorry if this is somehow documented somewhere, and I missed it.\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/5770/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0,

call to against localstack in a container, it causes localstack to die and restart. \r\n\r\nI am using a Mac M1 that has been upgraded to Monterey 12.3.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, this is related to the security cipher that curl uses, as the browser works correct, and I can get it to work correctly if I force a specific cipher that matches the browser. ie \r\n`curl -v -k --ciphers

file\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nI am using the default docker-compose in the master branch.\r\n\r\n#### How are you starting localstack (e.g., `bin/localstack` command, arguments, or `docker-compose.yml`)\r\n\r\n    docker-compose up -d\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Clone localstack project locally\r\n- Run `docker-compose up -d`\r\n- run this command `curl -v -k https://localhost:4566/health`\r\n\r\nExpected: A response would be returned with the service health.\r\nActual: \r\n```\r\n*   Trying 127.0.0.1:4566...\r\n* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port

However, it appears to die before the request ever even makes it to the localstack python code (as that's where I was debugging). I wasn't sure where to troubleshoot further or find logs additional logs. The only info that shows up in the localstack logs is this:\r\n```\r\n2022-03-24 13:26:41,955 INFO exited: infra (terminated by SIGSEGV; not expected)\r\n2022-03-24 13:26:42,969 INFO spawned: 'infra'

Please send all future requests to this endpoint.\r\n```\n\n### How are you starting LocalStack?\n\nWith a docker-compose file\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n#### How are you starting localstack (e.g., `bin/localstack` command, arguments, or `docker-compose.yml`)\r\n\r\n   docker-compose.yml\r\n\r\n#### Client commands (e.g., AWS SDK code snippet, or sequence of \"awslocal\" commands)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-bucket --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 --region eu-west-1\r\n{\r\n    \"Location\": \"http://my-bucket.s3.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/\"\r\n}\r\n$ aws s3api get-bucket-location --bucket my-bucket  --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 --region eu-west-2\r\n{\r\n    \"LocationConstraint\": \"eu-west-2\"\r\n}\r\n$ aws s3api get-bucket-location --bucket my-bucket  --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 --region eu-west-1\r\n{\r\n    \"LocationConstraint\": \"eu-west-1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Environment\n\n```markdown\n- OS: MacOS 12.2.1\r\n- LocalStack: 0.14.1\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/5748/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/5748/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/5747", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/5747/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/5747/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/5747/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/localstack/localstack/issues/5747", "id": 1180134853, "node_id": "I_kwDOBEnY0s5GV23F", "number": 5747, "title": "Web Console: Lambda - Allow expanding lambda logs", "user": {"login": "LukaHedt", "id": 93953637, "node_id": "U_kgDOBZmeZQ", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93953637?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt", "html_url": "https://github.com/LukaHedt", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/LukaHedt/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 720023316, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw3MjAwMjMzMTY=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/labels/web-ui", "name": "web-ui", "color": "d65c7c", "default": false, "description": null}, {"id": 2695724013, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyNjk1NzI0MDEz", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/labels/feature-request", "name": "feature-request", "color": "B9A2E0", "default": false, "description": ""}, {"id": 3453233917, "node_id": "LA_kwDOBEnY0s7N1Cr9", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/labels/aws:lambda", "name": "aws:lambda", "color": "F29100", "default": false, "description": "AWS Lambda"}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-03-24T22:53:22Z", "updated_at": "2022-03-29T11:28:48Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Feature description\n\nCurrently the Localstack Web Console truncates long logs in the lambda page.\r\n\r\nIdeally, a method of viewing the entire log would be ideal.
