First question is that this parameters are for which data? \r\n```\r\ntts_schedule = [(2,  1e-3,  20_000,  12),   # Progressive training schedule\r\n                (2,  5e-4,  40_000,  12),   # (r, lr, step, batch_size)\r\n                (2,  2e-4,  80_000,  12),   #\r\n                (2,  1e-4, 160_000,  12),   # r = reduction factor (# of mel frames\r\n                (2,  3e-5, 320_000,  12),   #     synthesized for each decoder iteration)\r\n                (2,  1e-5, 640_000,  12)],  # lr = learning rate\r\n```\r\nIn my case I have about 92000 utterances from 60 speaker in new language so second question is that what lr and steps may be best using batch-size=32 ? Or generally how to change these parameters for new data?
