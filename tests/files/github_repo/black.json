syntax.\r\nI've also tested this locally:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44469195/160990792-58f1f950-dbd0-4f1a-9173-58a80a6336d5.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you

Thanks for submitting a PR. To help make things go a bit more\r\n     smoothly we would appreciate that you go through this template. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHi, first time contributor here! This PR fixes #2917 . The issue was that fmt skip comments were being handled inconsistently. A formatted version of the comment (e.g. `#fmt:skip` -> `# fmt:skip` in `comment.value`) was being compared to the original comment in the code (e.g. `#fmt:skip` in `leaf.prefix`), which would always be False.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there's anything I missed. I left a comment below explaining one of the changes. Also, does this change require a changelog entry or documentation change?\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry. Otherwise, signal to us\r\n    this should get the magical label to silence the CHANGELOG entry check.\r\n    Tests are required for bugfixes and new features. Documentation changes\r\n    are necessary for formatting and most enhancement changes. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n- [ ] Add new / update outdated documentation?\r\n\r\n<!-- Just as a reminder, everyone in all psf/black spaces including PRs\r\n     must follow the PSF Code of Conduct (link below).\r\n\r\n     Finally, once again thanks for your time and effort.

Description\r\n\r\nOne of the things discussed in issue #144 was quote placement. Reading through the discussion, there seemed (to me, at least) to be general support for normalising this.\r\n\r\nThis does two things. For very short docstrings,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Why is this on its own line?\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"Why is this on its own line?\"\"\"\r\n```\r\nand for docstrings of more than one line, a single newline at the start and (pre-indent) end are enforced, so\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"Words\r\n\r\n    More words\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    \r\n    Words\r\n\r\n    More words\r\n\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\nboth become\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Words\r\n\r\n    More words\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\nwhich seemed to be the more popular style (compared with having no newline line at the start) in the #144 thread.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, any docstring with only one line of content will be converted to the one-line form. This may be problematic if it is very long, but I'm not sure what the line-length limit should be if this were changed: the normal line length limit, or 72 characters as specified by PEP 8 (which I'm not sure actually applies to single-line docstrings), or something else?\r\n\r\nI changed some tests files where the docstring formatting didn\u2019t seem relevant, so as not to have two copies of too many test files.\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t reformat Black\u2019s own source code with this change. There are parts of Black\u2019s source that are already affected by `--preview`, so maybe this should change at the same time.\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n- [x] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add new / update outdated documentation?\r\n", "created_at": "2022-02-17T18:28:26Z", "updated_at": "2022-03-28T21:22:14Z", "closed_at":

resolution improvements</h3>\n<p>Markdown links are of the format <code>[text](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/link)</code>.\nMyST-Parser looks to smartly resolve such links, by identifying if they are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A link to an external resource, e.g. <code>[text](http://example.com)</code></li>\n<li>A link to another source document, e.g. <code>[text](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/file.md)</code>\n<ul>\n<li>If <code>header-anchors</code> are enabled, anchor links are also supported, e.g. <code>[text](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/file.md#anchor)</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A link to an internal sphinx cross-reference, e.g.

"body": "This introduces a style helper for styling your logs to get a bit *pretty* output in the terminal. \r\n\r\nIt adds an `OutputLevels` enum which can be used to define the level of the message \"log\" you are *outputting*. You can still use the old manual styles by passing `fg`, `bold`, `dim`, etc. individually to the function `black.output.out()`, but if they are specified alongside with `style=` kwarg (which specifies the `OutputLevels`) the manual styles would over-write the style specified by the `style=` kwarg. An example use case is:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nout(\r\n\terror_msg if report.return_code else \"All done! \u2728 \ud83c\udf70 \u2728\",\r\n\tstyle=OutputLevels.success,\r\n\tbold=False,\r\n)\r\n# The final style would be {\"fg\": \"green\", \"bold\": False} \r\n# (as we are overwriting it by manually passing `bold=False`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current terminal output looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from

just picked up what I think would be okay for the level.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n- [X] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary?\r\n- [X] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n- [ ] Add new

Thanks for submitting a PR. To help make things go a bit more\r\n     smoothly we would appreciate that you go through this template. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n## What?\r\n\r\nI've added support for formatting Python Markdown code blocks. \r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nThese changes allow the user to format markdown files and strings. In one instance of my own (https://github.com/sunset-developer/sanic-security), I have a plethora of Python examples in my project's README.md. However, none of these examples are formatted with Black and doing so would entail me going through the pain staking process of replacing each code block example. With these changes, black can be used to automatically format all markdown code blocks instantly, and conveniently. \r\n\r\n## How?\r\n\r\nWhen Black is ran, the user would add the --docs flag in order to format any markdown files. Once ran, each code block in the Markdown is retrieved via regex and added to a list. Then, each one of these code blocks is formatted. Once each code block is formatted, the original non-formatted code block is replaced by the formatted code block and the new formatted Markdown string is returned. If no changes are made or the Markdown is empty, a `NothingChanged` error is thrown.\r\n\r\n## Testing?\r\n\r\nUnit tests have been written to make sure all desired functionality works as intended. Test data has also been created to be used as reference. \r\n\r\nFunctionality tested:\r\n\r\n* Empty Markdown raises `NothingChanged` error.\r\n* Markdown without Python code blocks raises `NothingChanges` error.\r\n* Markdown code block formatting cross-referenced with already formatted Markdown code blocks.\r\n* `--docs` flag.\r\n* Formatting Markdown strings and files.\r\n\r\nI am very open to feedback and any changes you would like me to make. Thank you for your time.\r\n\r\nIf you like these changes, I plan on adding support for .rst  and .tex files as well.\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry.

https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2680\r\nTest that replicates bug (see fmtskip7.py in tests/data): \r\n```py\r\na, b = 1, 2\r\nc =   6 #fmt: skip\r\nd = 5\r\n```\r\nResolve: It's seen that of all the formatting options, the inline option, or # fmt skip causes an internal error for black, when the comment should be reformatted like # fmt off. A proposal for this issue was made in the  fmtskip_nospace branch which aims to hard code logic handling this bug within the make_comment function of comments.py. \r\n\r\n\r\nNote: This does NOT handle arbitrary spacing for the # fmt: skip which should be handled in another pull request. \r\n\r\nIssues with current pull request: Building on different platforms fails due to the unit test fmtskip7.py failing when running pre-config. An investigation is further needed to resolve this issue.\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [X] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary? \r\n- [X] Add / update tests if necessary?

Also, this depends a lot on the target machine (slower machines will probably have more to gain)... in my machine I'd say there's around a 50% increase in the startup speed. There's still room for improvement, but I'd say that the low-hanging fruits have been taken care of.\r\n\r\nThe number of imported modules for doing a run in this case went from `268` to `202`.\r\n\r\nIt went something as:\r\n\r\nModules imported (baseline):\r\n268\r\n\r\nWithout asyncio:\r\n235\r\n\r\nWithout concurrent.futures\r\n222\r\n\r\nWithout pathspec:\r\n214\r\n\r\nWithout multiprocessing:\r\n202\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry.

Had completed them before vacation and didn't get time to open them until now :)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWoohoo! Module specific configuration! and a bit of restructuring of code in the `black/__init__.py` file. Mainly shifting all the \"reformatting\" logic to a separate function to increase the readability of code in the click CLI  function. You can go through the code in the commit, code should be self explanatory, though I still need to update the documentation of the code and this feature.\r\n\r\nI haven't aimed at bringing new tests in this commit, if required, I could do that and this rather fixes the tests to work according to the change I have done in this commit.\r\n\r\nSummarising the changes:\r\n- Now, you can support file/module specific configuration in the pyproject.toml config under the section of `[tools.black-module]`. I have added a separate \"key\" for the modules as according to the current code when the module name could clash with a config argument. For example `[tools.black.src]` would clash with `SRC`.\r\n\r\n- Module specific configuration can only some arguments which are listed under a global constant in `config.py` and should agree with the type hint present on them in the class variables, the logic for this functionality can be seen in `cast_typehint` function of `config.py`. At some places I have ignored MYPY errors so as I couldn't change the configuration since they were being used for typing.\r\n\r\n- Added a new class for storing all the parameters, the order of the arguments is as follows:\r\n  * Read global pyproject.toml/specified config config.\r\n  * Read module specific config, which would take the none specified arguments from the global configuration.\r\n  * If value specified through click options/arguments it would be overwritten, this won't happen if the default value of the option is taken.\r\n  * Tada!\r\n\r\nCloses #1370\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n- [ ] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary?\r\n- [ ] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n- [ ] Add new / update outdated documentation?\r\n", "created_at": "2021-10-07T08:31:21Z",

pyproject.toml which does the same job as the CLI option `--config`. The path of config should be relative to the CWD it is running from. If the file is not found or is invalid i.e. it is a folder rather a TOML file it would raise `click.exceptions.FileError`, and if the file can't be parsed it would raise `tomli.TOMLDecodeError`. All black config keys in the custom config should be registered under `[black]` and they would overwrite the config specified in pyproject but not the one specified by `--config` flag while running black with the CLI.\r\n\r\nI also did a small update to `.gitignore` by grouping the \"test\" and adding `htmlcov` to it. Which is generated by `coverage html` and `.pytest_cache/` produced when you run `pytest .`.\r\n\r\nCloses #1826\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n- [x] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary?\r\n-

as well as zero-length files are not reformatted but kept intact. In #2382 the consensus was that all of these should become a file with a single empty line, i.e. just a linefeed character.\r\n\r\nAlso, currently `black.format_str()` turns all-whitespace strings into zero-length strings, which is inconsistent compared to the command line and the `black.format_file_contents()` function. Wtih this patch, both functions reformat the source into a single newline.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes issue #2382.\r\n\r\n**Note:** See comments for the discussion on whether **zero-length** files should be kept intact, turned into a single LF, or turned into a single platform-dependent line terminator.\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n- [x] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add /

large impact on existing codebases.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, `black` will now keep user-inserted optional parentheses if at least `1` delimiter with `LOGIC_PRIORITY` or higher is present. This would allow developers the option to actively choose the improved style while not changing existing codebases.\r\n\r\n_If the idea itself is excepted, we could also discuss if this change should apply to all delimiters._\r\n\r\nExample style\r\n```py\r\n        return subscript_start is not None and any(\r\n            n.type in TEST_DESCENDANTS for n in subscript_start.pre_order()\r\n

Description\r\n\r\nTwo month ago, #2744 introduced a way to support formatting of jupyter cells with custom python cell magics.\r\nIn the current FAQ it is mentioned that this would not be possible: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#why-is-my-jupyter-notebook-cell-not-formatted\r\nTherefore I updated the FAQ and mentioned the new `black --python-cell-magics writeline hello.ipynb` syntax.\r\nI've also tested this locally:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44469195/160990792-58f1f950-dbd0-4f1a-9173-58a80a6336d5.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you

To confirm this, you have three options:\r\n\r\n1. Update Black's version if a newer release exists: `pip install -U black`\r\n2. Use the online formatter at <https://black.vercel.app/?version=main>, which will use\r\n   the latest main branch.\r\n3. Or run _Black_ on your machine:\r\n   - create a new virtualenv (make sure it's the same Python version);\r\n   - clone this repository;\r\n   - run `pip install -e .[d]`;\r\n   - run `pip install -r test_requirements.txt`\r\n   - make sure it's sane by running `python -m pytest`; and\r\n   - run `black` like you did last time.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nSince [bd96139](https://github.com/psf/black/commit/bd961304b63ad8178610df7242edf180d825e336), Docker images use a user install of Black. This means they can't be used when running a container as a user other than root. \r\n\r\nThis is a problem for me because we run Black inside of Jenkins and Jenkins runs _all_ containers with the same UID as the host, meaning that Black cannot run because it isn't on the PATH and in any case `/root/.local/bin/black` is inaccessible. It also seems like it could be problematic in any situation where the Black Docker container needs to write a file, because files it creates must be owned by root.\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nPreviously this would work:\r\n```\r\n$ docker run --rm -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $PWD:/workspace -w /workspace pyfound/black:21.9b0 black --check .\r\nAll done! \u2728 \ud83c\udf70 \u2728\r\n4 files would be left unchanged.\r\n```\r\nHowever on versions 21.10b0 and up, including the latest 22.3.0 I get the following output:\r\n```\r\n$ docker run --rm -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $PWD:/workspace -w /workspace pyfound/black:21.10b0 black --check .\r\ndocker: Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:380: starting container process caused: exec: \"black\": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown.\r\n$ docker run --rm -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $PWD:/workspace -w /workspace pyfound/black:22.3.0 black --check .\r\ndocker: Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:380: starting container process caused: exec: \"black\": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI should be able to run the Black Docker container as any user, not just root.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Please complete the following information: -->\r\n\r\n- Black's version: 21.10b0, 22.3.0\r\n- OS and Python version: [Linux/Python 3.10.4]\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2975/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2975/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2970", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2970/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2970/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2970/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/psf/black/pull/2970", "id": 1183931248, "node_id": "PR_kwDOB3dpmM41Lnur", "number": 2970, "title": "Correctly handle fmt skip comments without internal spaces", "user": {"login": "siuryan", "id": 23638799, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4Nzk5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638799?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/siuryan", "html_url": "https://github.com/siuryan", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/siuryan/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/siuryan/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/siuryan/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/siuryan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/siuryan/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/siuryan/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/siuryan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/siuryan/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/siuryan/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2022-03-28T20:09:15Z", "updated_at": "2022-03-28T20:35:03Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/pulls/2970", "html_url": "https://github.com/psf/black/pull/2970", "diff_url": "https://github.com/psf/black/pull/2970.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/psf/black/pull/2970.patch", "merged_at": null}, "body": "<!-- Hello!

The issue was that fmt skip comments were being handled inconsistently. A formatted version of the comment (e.g. `#fmt:skip` -> `# fmt:skip` in `comment.value`) was being compared to the original comment in the code (e.g. `#fmt:skip` in `leaf.prefix`), which would always be False.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there's anything I missed. I left a comment below explaining one of the changes. Also, does this change require a changelog entry or documentation change?\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry.

(I only occasionally setup rope when I need it.)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI would like to have the user/host gitignore files respected when project root `.gitignore` is used.\r\n\r\n`get_gitignore` could use similar logic to `find_user_pyproject_toml` to add the lines from the user ignore file.\r\nUnfortunately this file is specified as either a default location or with a git configuration.  \r\nFrom https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore\r\n\r\n\r\n> Which file to place a pattern in depends on how the pattern is meant to be used.\r\n> \r\n> Patterns which should be version-controlled and distributed to other repositories via clone (i.e., files that all developers will want to ignore) should go into a .gitignore file.\r\n> \r\n> Patterns which are specific to a particular repository but which do not need to be shared with other related repositories (e.g., auxiliary files that live inside the repository but are specific to one user\u2019s workflow) should go into the $GIT_DIR/info/exclude file.\r\n> \r\n> Patterns which a user wants Git to ignore in all situations (e.g., backup or temporary files generated by the user\u2019s editor of choice) generally go into a file specified by core.excludesFile in the user\u2019s ~/.gitconfig. Its default value is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is either not set or empty, $HOME/.config/git/ignore is used instead.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nAdd user specific files to project's `.gitignore`\r\nIt wouldn't hurt to add vim and other tools to the project specific ignore files, but feels like I would be adding many user settings to a project.  Although arguments for `.DS_Store` being in the project's `.gitignore` is applicable for a project that is typically developed on Mac OS, it is just on the threshold.\r\n\r\nAdding vim swap files seems more user vs. project specific.\r\n\r\nA workaround that I see now from researching for this bug would be to use `$GIT_DIR/info/exclude` but would also need to then have that path added into black.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nHonestly this may be a non-issue, as it only affects my worktrees and not other users.\r\nIt may break future use of --check as unintentional user folders were included...\r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2929/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart":

\r\n\r\n```python\r\nvalue = data[\"long_key_name_0\"][\"long_key_name_1\"][\"long_key_name_2\"][\r\n    \"long_key_name_3\"\r\n][\"long_key_name_4\"][\"long_key_name_5\"][\"long_key_name_6\"][\"long_key_name_7\"][\r\n    \"long_key_name_8\"\r\n][\r\n    \"long_key_name_9\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this would be my desired format:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nvalue = (\r\n    data\r\n    [\"long_key_name_0\"]\r\n    [\"long_key_name_1\"]\r\n    [\"long_key_name_2\"]\r\n    [\"long_key_name_3\"]\r\n    [\"long_key_name_4\"]\r\n    [\"long_key_name_5\"]\r\n    [\"long_key_name_6\"]\r\n    [\"long_key_name_7\"]\r\n    [\"long_key_name_8\"]\r\n    [\"long_key_name_9\"]\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to the following open issues:\r\n* https://github.com/psf/black/issues/510\r\n* https://github.com/psf/black/issues/571\r\n* https://github.com/psf/black/issues/814\r\n*

a combination between fluent interface and subscript notation), I decided to open a new issue for it. \r\n\r\nPossible labels:\r\n* linebreak\r\n* design\r\n* parentheses\r\n* symmetry\r\n",

causes `INTERNAL ERROR: Black produced different code on the second pass of the formatter`\r\n\r\nAlso the same code, if run with `--fast` creates incorrectly formatted code with multiple copies of the comment on the next line.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nFor example, take this code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport re\r\n\r\nline = \"some dummy data\"\r\nlog_search = re.search('CLOCK:\\s*(\\[.*\\])--(\\[.*\\])\\s*=>\\s*(\\d*:\\d*)', line)  #fmt:skip\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd run it with these arguments:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ black fmt_skip.py .\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting error is:\r\n\r\nerror: cannot format fmt_skip.py: INTERNAL ERROR: Black produced different code on the second pass of the formatter.  Please report a bug on https://github.com/psf/black/issues.  This diff might be helpful: /var/folders/cs/p77vt_fn271bcw6gw69d_2y40000gn/T/blk_i64a7rxi.log\r\n\r\nALSO\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ black fmt_skip.py . --fast\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting error is that the output is:\r\n```python\r\nimport re\r\n\r\nline = \"some dummy data\"\r\nlog_search = re.search('CLOCK:\\s*(\\[.*\\])--(\\[.*\\])\\s*=>\\s*(\\d*:\\d*)', line)  #fmt:skip\r\n  # fmt:skip  # fmt:skip\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nBlack should not change the line format as it is marked to be skipped.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n* MacOS 12.2.1\r\n* Python 3.8.5\r\n* black

#144 was quote placement. Reading through the discussion, there seemed (to me, at least) to be general support for normalising this.\r\n\r\nThis does two things. For very short docstrings,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Why is this on its own line?\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"Why is this on its own line?\"\"\"\r\n```\r\nand for docstrings of more than one line, a single newline at the start and (pre-indent) end are enforced, so\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"Words\r\n\r\n    More words\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    \r\n    Words\r\n\r\n    More words\r\n\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\nboth become\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Words\r\n\r\n    More words\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\nwhich seemed to be the more popular style (compared with having no newline line at the start) in the #144 thread.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, any docstring with only one line of content will be converted to the one-line form. This may be problematic if it is very long, but I'm not sure what the line-length limit should be if this were changed: the normal line length limit, or 72 characters as specified by PEP 8 (which I'm not sure actually applies to single-line docstrings), or something else?\r\n\r\nI changed some tests files where the docstring formatting didn\u2019t seem relevant, so as not to have two copies of too many test files.\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t reformat Black\u2019s own source code with this change. There are parts of Black\u2019s source that are already affected by `--preview`, so maybe this should change at the same time.\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n- [x] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add new / update outdated documentation?\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2885/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 1, "-1": 3, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2885/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2883", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2883/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2883/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2883/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2883", "id": 1138053821, "node_id": "I_kwDOB3dpmM5D1VK9", "number": 2883, "title": "Black over Language Server Protocol and VS Code extension", "user": {"login": "karthiknadig", "id": 3840081, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDAwODE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3840081?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/karthiknadig", "html_url": "https://github.com/karthiknadig", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/karthiknadig/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/karthiknadig/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/karthiknadig/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/karthiknadig/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/karthiknadig/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/karthiknadig/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/karthiknadig/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/karthiknadig/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/karthiknadig/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 867432796, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw4Njc0MzI3OTY=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/labels/T:%20enhancement", "name": "T: enhancement", "color": "a2eeef", "default": false, "description": "New feature or request"}, {"id": 1348564996, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMzQ4NTY0OTk2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/labels/C:%20integrations", "name": "C: integrations", "color": "c5def5", "default": false, "description": "Editor plugins and other integrations"}, {"id": 2955619138, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyOTU1NjE5MTM4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/labels/C:%20maintenance", "name": "C: maintenance", "color": "505678", "default": false, "description": "Related to project maintenance, e.g. CI, testing, policy changes, releases"}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 6, "created_at": "2022-02-15T01:21:10Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-22T20:05:28Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "The [Python team for VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python) has been working on putting various tools we support behind [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) and breaking them out into their own extensions This work is now far enough along that we wanted to share the extension prototypes for your tool with you and see if you had any interest in owning the extension or the Python-based LSP server backing it yourself?\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to take on that responsibility that's totally fine and understandable! If you want to leave the extension to us we would then publish the extension on the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) ourselves. We also plan to publish the extension as open source and support the extension for as long as we felt it made sense based on usage numbers. But due to the difficulty of migrating extension ownership, we wanted to ask early whether you wanted to own the extension from the start? If you did want to own the extension we would give you the code, help you publish to the VS Code Marketplace, and do anything else we can to help you be successful with this.\r\n\r\nWe have attached a zip file to this issue containing a prototype extension to give you an idea of what we are planning. You can download it, extract the `.vsix` file, and then [install the VSIX](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix) to try it out [python-black.zip](https://github.com/psf/black/files/8066039/python-black.zip). This prototype version was built with python 3.10 and bundles black v22.1.0 (as fallback if nothing is found in your environment).\r\n\r\nTo be very clear, there's no pressure or expectations from us.

number of breaking improvements.</p>\n<p>Full Changelog: <a href=\"https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/compare/v0.16.1...v0.17.0\">v0.16.1...v0.17.0</a></p>\n<h3>\u203c\ufe0f Markdown link resolution improvements</h3>\n<p>Markdown links are of the format <code>[text](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/link)</code>.\nMyST-Parser looks to smartly resolve such links, by identifying if they are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A link to an external resource, e.g. <code>[text](http://example.com)</code></li>\n<li>A link to another source document, e.g. <code>[text](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/file.md)</code>\n<ul>\n<li>If <code>header-anchors</code> are enabled, anchor links are also supported, e.g. <code>[text](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/file.md#anchor)</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A link to an internal sphinx cross-reference, e.g. <code>[text](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/my-reference)</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>an additional situation is now supported:</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>A link to a source file, which is not a document, e.g. <code>[text](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/file.js)</code>. This behaves similarly to the sphinx <code>download</code> role.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In addition, configuration to more finely tune this behaviour has been added.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>myst_all_links_external=True</code>, will make all links be treated as (1)</li>\n<li><code>myst_url_schemes=(&quot;http&quot;, &quot;https&quot;)</code>, sets what URL schemes are treated as (1)</li>\n<li><code>myst_ref_domains=(&quot;std&quot;, &quot;py&quot;)</code>, sets what Sphinx reference domains are checked, when handling (3)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/docs/syntax/syntax.md#markdown-links-and-referencing\">Markdown Links and Referencing</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3>\u203c\ufe0f Dollarmath is now disabled by default</h3>\n<p>The default configuration is now <code>myst_enable_extensions=()</code>, instead of <code>myst_enable_extensions=(&quot;dollarmath&quot;,)</code>.\nIf you are using math enclosed in <code>$</code> or <code>$$</code> in your documents, you should enable <code>dollarmath</code> explicitly.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/docs/syntax/optional.md#math-shortcuts\">Dollar delimited math</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3>\u2b06\ufe0f Drop Python 3.6 support</h3>\n<p>MyST-Parser now supports, and is tested against, Python 3.7 to 3.10.</p>\n<h3>\u2728 Add the <code>strikethrough</code> extension and <code>myst_gfm_only</code> configuration</h3>\n<p>The <code>strikethrough</code> extension allows text within <code>~~</code> delimiters to have a strike-through (horizontal line) placed over it.\nFor example, <code>~~strikethrough with *emphasis*~~</code> renders as: <del>strikethrough with <em>emphasis</em></del>.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: This extension is currently only supported for HTML output.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/docs/syntax/optional.md#strikethrough\">Strikethrough</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>The <code>myst_gfm_only=True</code> configuration sets up specific configuration, to enable compliance only with <a href=\"https://github.github.com/gfm/\">GitHub-flavored Markdown</a>, including enabling the <code>strikethrough</code>, <code>tasklist</code> and <code>linkify</code> extensions, but disabling support for roles and directives.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
